## What exactly does Intelligent Document Processing mean?

!!! info "Definitions Compiled from Multiple Sources"

    === "Wikipedia"
    
        A technology called automatic document processing or sometimes intelligent document processing (IDP) emerged as a specific form of Intelligent Process Automation (IPA), combining artificial intelligence such as Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Intelligent Character Recognition (ICE) to extract data from several types documents. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_processing#:~:text=A%20technology%20called,%5B8%5D)
    
    === "Gartner"
    
        Gartner defines intelligent document processing (IDP) solutions as specialized data integration tools enabling automated extraction of data from multiple formats and varying layouts of document content. IDP solutions ingest data for dependent applications and workflows, and can be provided as a software product and/or as a service.

    === "IBM"
    
        Intelligent document processing is designed to extract business critical data, enabling better, faster decision-making and driving business performance. [Source](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/intelligent-document-processing)
    
    === "Amazon AWS"
    
        Intelligent document processing (IDP) is automating the process of manual data entry from paper-based documents or document images to integrate with other digital business processes. [Source](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/intelligent-document-processing/)
    
    === "Microsoft"
    
        Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) is a software solution that captures, transforms, and processes data from documents (e.g., e-mail, text, Word, PDF, or scanned documents). Using AI technologies such as computer vision, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and machine/deep learning, the extracted data can be analyzed, categorized, transformed, and exported to external systems in an end-to-end process.
