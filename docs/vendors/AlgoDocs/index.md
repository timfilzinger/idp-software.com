## Overview

AlgoDocs is an Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) software vendor that uses Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) to identify handwritten texts, allowing for maximum accuracy and automation and efficiently converting texts into letter codes for ready use in various applications. 

Although businesses increasingly automate various processes, they still rely on paper and pen for many day-to-day needs. AlgoDocs uses deep learning algorithms that make it possible to digitize handwritten paper documents. With AlgoDocs’ [ICR technology](https://www.algodocs.com/extract-handwritten-text-from-scanned-pdfs-and-images/), businesses can quickly scan paper documents, and AlgoDocs will extract the data, converting it into the desired form, including Excel or JSON. The result is easily searchable and readily editable data: clear, concise, usable text.

Seamlessly import text files from OneDrive, Gmail, Dropbox, and other popular applications. Transfer, convert, enhance, and automate even large volumes of data quickly and efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Document Automation**: Streamlined preprocessing and data extraction that eliminates manual data processing and saves time and expense
- **Pattern-Based Extraction**: AlgoDocs requires no preset templates and features trainable models for maximum customizability.
- **Scalability**: ICR technology can process large volumes of data efficiently as needed without the need for extra labor
- **Seamless Integration**: Software readily integrates with ERP, CRM, HR, and other systems
- **Security**: AlgoDocs is designed with security in mind and complies with security regulations with encrypted records and state-of-the-art features.

## Use Cases

### Healthcare 

Many hospitals and healthcare systems have turned to digital records, but handwritten documents remain common. Healthcare systems can use AlgoDocs to scan and convert paper records into editable digital formats, enhance documents, improve accuracy, and convert documents into machine-readable texts. This can improve operational efficiency, freeing medical professionals from tedious paperwork tasks, allowing them to focus on their patients and enjoy smoother workflow, greater cost savings, and overall patient satisfaction. ICR can also be used to extract patient data, medical codes, insurance details, diagnosis reports, and more. 

### Legal 

Law firms depend on data, and while many of their documents are digitized, not all are. Both ICR and IDP automate the identification and extraction of critical data from legal documents. Experts can quickly analyze legal documents, identify and extract key details in contracts, review mergers and acquisitions, and complete legal research, highlighting key details in a fraction of the time it might take associates to spot patterns and details.

### Banking

One of the first industries to adopt OCR, banks are still one of the top users of this technology today. Before OCR, data entry clerks manually keyed in the information from each financial instrument. This was both time- and labor-intensive and prone to errors. AI-based tools like ICR process checks and other financial instruments exponentially faster and dramatically reduce the risk of errors, granting clients access to their funds faster, reducing overhead costs, and boosting bottom lines.
