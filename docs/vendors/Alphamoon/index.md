### Logistics

Effortlessly track shipments with the help of Alphamoon document automation. OCR can also help manage supply chain processes, enhance logistics, and [extract data](https://idp-software.com/capabilities/extraction/) from various documents, including customs forms, delivery notes, waybills, and more.
