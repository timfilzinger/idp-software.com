## Overview

AmyGB has evolved from providing an end-to-end e-mail automation system to offering a fully comprehensive [intelligent document processing (IDP) platform] (https://www.amygb.ai/intelligent-document-processing). Gen AI-powered VisionERA analyzes and learns about each document, thereby saving workers a lot of time. Plus, VisionERA utilizes IDP that is free of any third-party dependency.

AmyGB works with a variety of industries, including healthcare, manufacturing, logistics, BFSI and retail. It also offers several industry solutions, ranging from vehicle RC verification to bank account verification. It has grown from a company of three in 2017 to employing more than 20 workers.
