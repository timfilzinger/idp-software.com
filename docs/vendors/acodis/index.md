## Overview

Acodis develops intelligent document processing software that transforms unstructured documents into structured data using artificial intelligence and machine learning. Founded in 2016 by three ETH Zurich graduates and rebranded from Turicode to Acodis in 2021, the company focuses on highly regulated industries including life sciences, financial services, manufacturing, and public sector organizations.

The platform processes documents in multiple languages without requiring templates, adapting to changing document layouts through AI models. Acodis serves customers including Syngenta and Roche, operating from its headquarters in Winterthur, Switzerland with data hosted in Swiss facilities for compliance requirements. The company raised CHF 6 million in Series A funding in 2023 led by Hi Inov and VI Partners.

- **AI-Powered Extraction**: Machine learning models extract text, tables, images, and document structures from unstructured content with over 95% accuracy
- **Template-Free Processing**: Adapts to varying document layouts without predefined templates through combined pre-trained and custom AI models
- **[Document Classification](../../capabilities/classification/index.md)**: Automatic categorization of incoming documents by type
- **Human-in-the-Loop Validation**: Verification interface for quality control and model training
- **Multilingual Support**: Processes documents in any language
- **GxP Compliance**: Meets pharmaceutical industry validation requirements
- **Enterprise Integration**: Connects with LIMS, QMS, ERP systems and RPA platforms via REST API

## Use Cases

### Life Sciences Document Processing

Pharmaceutical and biotech companies process regulatory documents, batch records, and laboratory reports through Acodis. The platform extracts data from manufacturing protocols, quality control documents, and submission packages while maintaining GxP compliance. Validation features ensure data accuracy for regulatory submissions.

### Invoice Processing

Finance departments automate extraction of vendor information, line items, dates, and amounts from invoices across multiple formats. The system validates data through cross-referencing and exports structured information in JSON or XML formats for integration with accounting systems.

### Contract Management

Legal and procurement teams extract key terms, dates, and obligations from contracts without manual review. The AI models identify relevant clauses and conditions regardless of document layout variations, accelerating contract analysis workflows.
