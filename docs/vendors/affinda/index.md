# Affinda

Affinda is an AI platform designed for intelligent document processing. It can be configured to process new document types, fast – requiring a few examples – so organizations don’t require weeks or months of lengthy model-training cycles. This enables teams to streamline document workflows, improve accuracy, reduce manual effort and achieve measurable productivity gains. Affinda provides practical, adoption-ready solutions for extraction, OCR, classification and validation across many industries, with clear paths to ROI.  Headquartered in Melbourne, Australia, Affinda serves customers in more than 80 countries in 56 languages, with teams across Asia Pacific, North America and Europe.

## Overview

With its new [platform](https://www.affinda.com/platform), Affinda addresses a core challenge in document processing: interpreting documents with the same contextual understanding humans apply. Instead of relying on static templates or long supervised-training cycles, the platform combines several advanced techniques to achieve this:

- **RAG model memory** to learn from new documents instantly
- **Grounded LLM extraction** that ties predictions back to the source document, reducing hallucinations
- **A proprietary OCR and reconstruction engine** that restores reading order, structure and context in complex layouts

This architecture allows Affinda’s agentic AI to split, classify, extract and validate data with 99%+ accuracy, enabling true straight-through processing across any [document type](https://www.affinda.com/documents), [industry](https://www.affinda.com/industries) or [use case](https://www.affinda.com/use-cases).
