## Overview

With its new [platform](https://www.affinda.com/platform), Affinda has solved one of the toughest challenges in document processing: teaching machines to read documents like humans.

Its agentic AI splits, sorts, extracts and validates with 99%+ accuracy, enabling true straight-through processing across any [document type](https://www.affinda.com/documents), [industry](https://www.affinda.com/industries) or [use case](https://www.affinda.com/use-cases).
