## Use Cases

### Private Equity Portfolio Monitoring

Private equity firms receive quarterly reports, capital call notices, and financial statements from portfolio companies in varying formats. Alkymi extracts key metrics including revenue, EBITDA, and cash position from these documents, standardizing the data regardless of source format. The platform populates portfolio monitoring dashboards and integrates with fund administration systems, eliminating manual data entry.

### Wealth Management Document Processing

Wealth advisors process client statements, transaction confirmations, and account documentation from multiple custodians. Alkymi identifies document types, extracts holdings and transaction details, and validates data accuracy. The system routes extracted information to portfolio management platforms, enabling advisors to maintain current client records without manual review.

### Alternative Investment Data Operations

Alternative investment firms manage subscription documents, side letters, and investor reporting across multiple fund structures. Alkymi reads and [classifies](../../capabilities/classification/index.md) these documents, extracts terms and commitments, and organizes information by investor and fund. The platform maintains a structured database of investment terms accessible through natural language queries.
