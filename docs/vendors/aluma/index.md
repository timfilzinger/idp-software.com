## Use Cases

### Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Automation

Pharmaceutical distributors process certificates of analysis, packing slips, and shipping documentation from global suppliers. Aluma classifies incoming documents by type, extracts batch numbers and expiration dates, and validates information against purchase orders. In a documented implementation, the system achieved 83% automated field extraction and 96% overall accuracy, reducing manual data entry in logistics operations.

### High-Volume Invoice Processing

Accounts payable departments handle invoices from thousands of vendors in varying formats. Aluma separates multi-invoice PDF files, classifies documents by vendor and invoice type, and extracts key fields including invoice number, date, amount, and line items. The platform integrates extracted data with ERP systems while routing exceptions for review.

### Records Management and E-Discovery

Legal and compliance teams digitize physical records and process electronic files for case management. Aluma performs OCR on scanned documents, classifies files by document type and matter, redacts privileged or sensitive information, and organizes content for searchability. Analytics track processing volumes and quality metrics across document collections.
