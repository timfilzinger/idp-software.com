# AOTM News Review

## Executive Summary

AOTM has been selected as one of 12 international exhibitors for Art Basel's inaugural Zero 10 digital art platform, launching December 5-7, 2025 at Miami Beach with VIP previews December 3-4 ([Art News](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/art-basel-zero-10-digital-art-platform-miami-beach-2025-1234760295/)). This selection positions AOTM within the traditional art market infrastructure through Art Basel's platform, providing access to 100,000 attendees and 10,000 onsite collectors at the Miami Beach fair ([Observer](https://observer.com/2025/11/art-basel-launch-zero-10-digital-art-section-miami-beach/)). The platform, curated by digital art strategist Eli Scheinman and supported by OpenSea, will expand to other Art Basel fairs in 2026, creating ongoing exposure opportunities for AOTM in a market where digital art represents 14 percent of fine-art spending and 51 percent of high-net-worth collectors purchased digital artwork in 2024/25.

## Key Developments

**Strategic Partnerships**: AOTM secured selection as one of 12 galleries and studios to participate in Art Basel's Zero 10 digital art platform, marking Art Basel's first major entry into the digital art market ([Observer](https://observer.com/2025/11/art-basel-launch-zero-10-digital-art-section-miami-beach/)). The platform launches on the main fair floor at Art Basel Miami Beach and will expand to other Art Basel fairs in 2026 ([Art News](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/art-basel-zero-10-digital-art-platform-miami-beach-2025-1234760295/)).

**Market Positioning**: AOTM will exhibit alongside established competitors including Pace Gallery, Beeple Studios, and Art Blocks in the curated platform, indicating recognition within the traditional art market establishment ([Art News](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/art-basel-zero-10-digital-art-platform-miami-beach-2025-1234760295/)).

## Market Context

The selection occurs as digital art has become the third-largest category of fine-art spending at 14 percent, with 51 percent of high-net-worth collectors purchasing digital artwork in 2024/25 ([Observer](https://observer.com/2025/11/art-basel-launch-zero-10-digital-art-section-miami-beach/)). Art Basel's entry into digital art through Zero 10 represents the traditional art market's formal embrace of digital collecting, supported by OpenSea's partnership ([Art News](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/art-basel-zero-10-digital-art-platform-miami-beach-2025-1234760295/)).

## Strategic Implications

AOTM's inclusion in Zero 10 provides access to Art Basel's established collector network and positions the company within traditional art market infrastructure rather than purely digital-native platforms. The platform's planned expansion to other Art Basel fairs in 2026 creates a multi-year growth platform for AOTM's digital art offerings ([Observer](https://observer.com/2025/11/art-basel-launch-zero-10-digital-art-section-miami-beach/)). This selection validates AOTM's competitive position among both traditional galleries transitioning to digital and established digital art specialists, potentially differentiating the company in a crowded market through association with Art Basel's prestige and collector base.
