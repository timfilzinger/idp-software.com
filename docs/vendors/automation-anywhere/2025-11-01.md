## News Review for automation-anywhere

# Automation Anywhere News Review

## Executive Summary

Automation Anywhere maintained its position as an established player in the enterprise automation market during this period, with the company being recognized as one of approximately 25 key vendors in the AI-RPA market projected to grow by USD 14.28 billion between 2024-2029 according to ResearchAndMarkets.com ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/08/3163244/28124/en/AI-in-RPA-Robotic-Process-Automation-Market-2025-2029-Key-Insights-for-Customer-Service-Automation-Finance-Accounting-IT-Infrastructure-Management-Human-Resources-and-Other-Applica.html)). The company joined a coalition of enterprise software providers including AWS and Box in supporting Okta's new Cross App Access (XAA) standard for securing AI agent communications ([IT News Australia](https://www.itnews.com.au/feature/okta-unveils-identity-fabric-to-secure-surge-in-enterprise-ai-agents-620928)), positioning itself to address security concerns in AI agent deployments where 91 percent of organizations use AI agents but only 10 percent have governance strategies. However, the company faces intensifying competition from well-funded AI-native startups like UnifyApps, which raised $50 million in Series B funding while positioning itself as purpose-built for AI rather than adapting older platforms ([Silicon Angle](https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/22/ai-operating-system-startup-unifyapps-raises-50m-gets-new-co-ceo/)), and from domain-specific solutions in verticals like healthcare where specialized AI models are outperforming generic RPA tools ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charliefink/2025/10/20/coral-ai-and-healthcares-450-billion-paperwork-problem/)).

## Key Developments

**Strategic Partnerships**: Automation Anywhere joined Okta's Cross App Access (XAA) standard coalition alongside AWS, Box, and other enterprise software providers to create a standardized security framework for AI agents accessing enterprise systems ([IT News Australia](https://www.itnews.com.au/feature/okta-unveils-identity-fabric-to-secure-surge-in-enterprise-ai-agents-620928)).

**Market Recognition**: The company was listed among 25 key players in ResearchAndMarkets.com's AI in RPA market analysis covering 2025-2029, providing third-party validation of its market presence ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/08/3163244/28124/en/AI-in-RPA-Robotic-Process-Automation-Market-2025-2029-Key-Insights-for-Customer-Service-Automation-Finance-Accounting-IT-Infrastructure-Management-Human-Resources-and-Other-Applica.html)).

**Executive Engagement**: Linda Ding, Senior Director of AI & Automation Products & Solutions, served as a speaker at HMG Strategy's 16th Annual Southern California C-Level Technology Leadership Summit, where Automation Anywhere participated as a Platinum Partner ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/07/3162753/0/en/Just-Two-Days-Left-to-Register-Southern-California-C-suite-executives-invited-to-HMG-Strategy-s-16th-Annual-C-Level-Technology-Leadership-Summit-on-October-9.html)).

**Channel Partner Activity**: Happiest Minds Technologies identified Automation Anywhere as one of the key automation platforms they implement for customers within their Product and Digital Engineering Services unit, serving six industry groups including BFSI, retail, manufacturing, and healthcare ([The Hindu Business Line](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/happiest-minds-bets-on-genai-and-new-sales-engine-to-sustain-double-digit-growth/article70217416.ece)).

## Market Context

The AI-RPA market is experiencing rapid growth with a projected 33% CAGR and USD 14.28 billion expansion between 2024-2029, driven by the emergence of agentic automation and autonomous AI agents. Automation Anywhere operates in an increasingly competitive landscape that includes both established automation specialists like UiPath, Blue Prism, and Appian, as well as big tech players like Microsoft, SAP, and Salesforce ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2025/10/02/robot-realities-the-road-to-autonomous-non-deterministic-ai-agents/)). The company faces particular pressure from AI-native startups that claim advantages through purpose-built architectures rather than adapted legacy platforms, while domain-specific solutions in verticals like healthcare are challenging generic RPA approaches with specialized AI models achieving higher accuracy rates.

## Strategic Implications

Automation Anywhere's support for the XAA security standard positions the company to capitalize on the gap between widespread AI agent adoption (91% of organizations) and limited governance strategies (10% have defined frameworks), potentially providing a competitive advantage in enterprise deployments requiring robust security compliance. However, the company must address competitive pressure from well-funded AI-native startups like UnifyApps that raised $50 million while claiming architectural advantages over legacy platforms. The company's continued presence in system integrator portfolios like Happiest Minds suggests strong channel relationships, but it faces the strategic challenge of evolving from traditional RPA to autonomous AI capabilities while defending its established customer base against both specialized vertical solutions and purpose-built AI platforms. The company's participation in executive-level events and industry coalitions indicates a focus on maintaining enterprise relationships and thought leadership positioning as the market transitions toward more sophisticated AI-driven automation solutions.
