# Automation Anywhere: Market Recognition and Agentic AI Strategy Drive 2025 Positioning

## Executive Summary

Automation Anywhere has secured recognition as a key player across multiple market analyses, positioning its A2019 platform and IQ Bot within the hyper-automation market projected to reach $179.96 billion by 2032 and the RPA market expected to expand to $247.34 billion by 2035. The company's strategic direction centers on advancing beyond traditional RPA toward agentic AI solutions, with SVP of agentic solutions Dustin Snell outlining a vision for real-time, auto-generated intelligence software that dynamically creates user interfaces and workflows while incorporating enterprise governance frameworks. This positioning comes as Automation Anywhere operates within the dominant RPA segment holding 37% of the hyper-automation market, though faces competitive pressure from emerging technologies like Computer Vision growing at 20.07% CAGR and the need to address both cloud-dominant deployments and expanding on-premise demand.

## Key Developments
