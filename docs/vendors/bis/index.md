## Use Cases

### Enterprise Document Migration

Organizations consolidating legacy content management systems migrate millions of documents to modern platforms. Grooper processes diverse document types, extracts metadata for classification, and validates content integrity during transfer. The platform's RAG capabilities enable intelligent routing based on document context and business rules without manual configuration.

### Financial Services Document Processing

Banks and lending institutions process loan applications, account opening documents, and compliance records. Grooper extracts applicant information, validates document completeness, and identifies missing or inconsistent data. Integration with core banking systems automates straight-through processing for standard applications while routing exceptions for review.

### Healthcare Records Management

Healthcare providers digitize patient records, insurance claims, and medical correspondence. Grooper [classifies](../../capabilities/classification/index.md) documents by type and patient, extracts clinical data and insurance information, and maintains audit trails for HIPAA compliance. The AI assistant enables clinicians to query patient document history using natural language.
