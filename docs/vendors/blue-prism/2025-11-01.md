## News Review for blue-prism

# Blue Prism News Review

## Executive Summary

SS&C Blue Prism has been recognized across multiple market research reports as a key player in the rapidly evolving automation and AI landscape, appearing in analyses for AI-enhanced RPA, causal AI, and agentic automation platforms. The company was identified among approximately 25 vendors in the AI in RPA market projected to grow by USD 14.28 billion through 2029 with a 33% CAGR ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/08/3163244/28124/en/AI-in-RPA-Robotic-Process-Automation-Market-2025-2029-Key-Insights-for-Customer-Service-Automation-Finance-Accounting-IT-Infrastructure-Management-Human-Resources-and-Other-Applica.html)), and was listed among 70+ companies in the causal AI market expected to reach $1.62 billion by 2035 ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/08/3163136/28124/en/Causal-AI-Market-Industry-Trends-and-Forecast-Report-2025-2035-Global-Causal-AI-Market-to-Reach-1-62-Billion-by-2035-Growing-at-38-35-CAGR.html)). Most notably, Everest Group analyst Amardeep Modi categorized Blue Prism as one of the process automation specialists competing against major enterprise software companies including Microsoft, SAP, Salesforce, and ServiceNow in the emerging agentic automation platform market ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2025/10/02/robot-realities-the-road-to-autonomous-non-deterministic-ai-agents/)), positioning the company alongside traditional automation competitors UiPath, Appian, and Automation Anywhere while highlighting the competitive pressure from big tech players expanding into automation.

## Key Developments

No specific product launches, strategic partnerships, financial performance updates, or leadership changes were reported for Blue Prism during this period. The developments were limited to market positioning and competitive recognition through industry analyst reports and market research studies.

## Market Context

Blue Prism operates within multiple converging technology markets experiencing substantial growth projections. The AI-enhanced RPA market is being driven by generative AI adoption and hyperautomation demand, with emphasis shifting toward agentic automation and autonomous AI agents ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/08/3163244/28124/en/AI-in-RPA-Robotic-Process-Automation-Market-2025-2029-Key-Insights-for-Customer-Service-Automation-Finance-Accounting-IT-Infrastructure-Management-Human-Resources-and-Other-Applica.html)). The company's inclusion in causal AI market research suggests the industry is moving beyond traditional pattern recognition toward technologies that understand cause-and-effect relationships ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/08/3163136/28124/en/Causal-AI-Market-Industry-Trends-and-Forecast-Report-2025-2035-Global-Causal-AI-Market-to-Reach-1-62-Billion-by-2035-Growing-at-38-35-CAGR.html)). The emergence of agentic automation platforms represents a new competitive battleground where traditional RPA vendors face increased competition from major enterprise software companies expanding into automation ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2025/10/02/robot-realities-the-road-to-autonomous-non-deterministic-ai-agents/)).

## Strategic Implications

Blue Prism's recognition across multiple market segments indicates the company is positioned to participate in the broader evolution of automation technology beyond traditional RPA. However, the competitive landscape analysis reveals the company faces dual pressure from both specialized automation vendors and major enterprise software companies entering the market with broader platform approaches. The company's inclusion in causal AI market research suggests potential strategic expansion opportunities beyond core RPA offerings into advanced AI capabilities that focus on understanding cause-and-effect relationships. To maintain competitive positioning, Blue Prism must adapt to market shifts toward autonomous AI agents, natural language interfaces, and the democratization of automation through generative AI while differentiating itself from both traditional automation competitors and big tech players with extensive platform capabilities.
