## Use Cases

### Accounts Payable Automation

Accounting teams receive supplier invoices via email and document portals. Boolfy extracts invoice header information, line item details, and tax calculations, routing the structured data to ERP systems. The platform's approval workflow enables managers to review and authorize invoices remotely, with authorization levels configured by amount thresholds or vendor type.

### Payment Reconciliation

Finance departments validate incoming payments against issued invoices. Boolfy reads bank transfer documents, extracts payment reference numbers and amounts, and matches transactions to open receivables. The system identifies discrepancies between expected and received amounts for investigation.

### Contract Management

Legal and procurement teams digitize contract portfolios for searchability and compliance tracking. Boolfy extracts party names, effective dates, renewal terms, and financial commitments from agreements. As users correct any extraction errors, the AI model learns to handle similar contract structures more accurately in future processing.
