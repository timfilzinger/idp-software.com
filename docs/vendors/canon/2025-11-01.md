# Canon Business News Review

## Executive Summary

Canon India launched 10 new printers across its PIXMA MegaTank and imageCLASS product lines in December 2024, targeting small and medium enterprises and home offices with cost-effective printing solutions during a period when the digital printing market is projected to grow at 6.1% CAGR to reach $57 billion by 2033 ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/31/3178476/28124/en/Digital-Printing-Market-Growth-Trends-Forecast-2025-2033-Rising-Demand-for-Cost-Effective-High-Speed-and-Customizable-Printing-Solutions-Driving-the-Market-at-6-1-CAGR-Reaching-57-.html)). However, the company faced security concerns when the UNC6384 threat group exploited Canon's legitimate printer assistant utilities (cnmpaui.exe, cnmpauix.exe, and cnmplog.dat) in cyber espionage attacks against European diplomatic entities and Serbian government aviation departments during September and October 2025, using DLL side-loading techniques to deploy PlugX malware ([Help Net Security](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/10/31/zdi-can-25373-cve-2025-9491-exploited-again/)). Meanwhile, Canon cameras received retail promotion through Best Buy's Early Black Friday sale with discounts up to $1,000, representing standard holiday season marketing efforts ([DealNews](https://www.dealnews.com/Best-Buy-Early-Black-Friday-Video-Game-Deals-Up-to-50-off-free-shipping/21780659.html)).

## Key Developments

**Product Launches**: Canon India released 10 new printer models in December 2024 across its PIXMA MegaTank and imageCLASS ranges, specifically designed for small and medium enterprises and home offices with features emphasizing high-quality prints, productivity, and cost-effectiveness.

**Security Incident**: Canon's legitimate printer utilities were exploited by cybercriminals in state-sponsored attacks targeting government entities across Hungary, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, and Serbia, with threat actors using the company's signed software to deploy malware while evading detection.

**Retail Promotions**: Canon cameras were featured in Best Buy's Early Black Friday promotional campaign with discounts reaching up to $1,000, part of the retailer's broader electronics sale strategy.

## Market Context

Canon's printer launch aligns with the expanding digital printing market, which is valued at $33.5 billion in 2024 and driven by rising demand for cost-effective, high-speed, and customizable printing solutions. The company's focus on SMB and home office segments positions it to capture growth in markets demanding short-run and customized printing capabilities. The security exploitation of Canon utilities reflects broader cybersecurity challenges facing technology companies, where legitimate software becomes a vector for sophisticated attacks against government and diplomatic targets.

## Strategic Implications

Canon's December 2024 printer launch demonstrates strategic focus on the growing SMB market segment during a period of digital printing market expansion, potentially strengthening its competitive position against vendors like HP and Konica Minolta. The security incident involving Canon utilities being exploited in state-sponsored attacks presents reputational risks and may require enhanced security measures for the company's software distribution and validation processes. The retail camera promotions indicate continued reliance on traditional seasonal marketing strategies to drive consumer electronics sales during peak shopping periods.
