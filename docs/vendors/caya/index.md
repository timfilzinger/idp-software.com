## Use Cases

### Tax Consultant Document Processing

Tax consulting firms digitize client mail by forwarding physical correspondence to Caya's scanning service. The Post Scan system captures incoming documents, classifies them by type (invoices, receipts, bank statements, tax forms), and routes items to appropriate client folders based on sender and document content. Document Extractions pulls invoice amounts, dates, vendor details, and expense categories for export to accounting software like DATEV. The system handles receipts by extracting transaction details for expense categorization, while contracts and official correspondence route to review queues. Mobile apps enable consultants to photograph on-site documents for immediate processing.

### Property Management Mail Automation

Property management companies process tenant correspondence, vendor invoices, and maintenance requests through automated routing workflows. Caya classifies incoming mail by property address and document type, distributing items to location-specific workspaces for regional managers. The platform extracts utility bill amounts and due dates for payment scheduling, routes maintenance quotes to approval workflows, and captures lease agreements for archive storage. Integration with property management software enables automatic invoice posting and tenant account updates. Multi-tenant architecture supports organizational hierarchies with permissions controlling document access by region, property, or user role.
