## Use Cases

### Document Format Conversion

Development teams integrate Cloudmersive APIs to convert documents between formats within applications. Systems transform uploaded user documents to standardized formats, migrate legacy documents for modern platforms, and create web-viewable versions of files. API responses enable seamless format conversion without dedicated infrastructure.

### Automated Data Extraction

Applications use [OCR APIs](../../capabilities/ocr/index.md) to extract text and structured data from scanned documents and images. Finance systems process invoice data, HR platforms digitize paper forms, and identity verification services capture information from ID documents. Extracted data integrates directly into databases and business systems through API responses.
