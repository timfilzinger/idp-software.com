# Coforge News Review

## Executive Summary

Coforge emerged as a standout performer in the Indian IT services sector during Q2FY26, achieving a 10 basis points year-over-year market share gain while larger competitors like TCS lost ground, and recording the highest growth among Tier-II IT companies at 4.5% USD quarter-over-quarter ([The Hindu Business Line](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/sequential-market-share-gains-mask-deeper-yearly-slide-for-indian-it/article70349573.ece), [Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indias-ai-losers-just-made-investors-richer-by-rs-2-6-lakh-crore-nobody-saw-the-boom-coming/articleshow/125554826.cms)).

The company's stock gained up to 31% since October as part of the broader IT sector recovery, though it trades at premium valuations of 30-35 times earnings, with analysts projecting EPS growth from 44.7 in FY26 to 74.3 in FY28 ([Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/no-growth-trigger-ahead-sandip-agarwal-flags-valuation-risks-in-it/articleshow/125453197.cms), [Economic Times](https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/motilal-oswals-top-10-small-midcap-picks-that-can-deliver-strong-eps-by-fy28-how-many-do-you-own/stong-outlook/slideshow/125428331.cms)).

## Key Developments

**Financial Performance**: Coforge delivered the strongest quarterly performance among mid-cap IT companies with 4.5% USD quarter-over-quarter growth in Q2FY26, outpacing both Tier-1 competitors and other mid-cap peers like Persistent Systems ([Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indias-ai-losers-just-made-investors-richer-by-rs-2-6-lakh-crore-nobody-saw-the-boom-coming/articleshow/125554826.cms)).

**Market Share Gains**: The company achieved a 10 basis points year-over-year market share increase in Q2FY26, positioning itself among the few India-based IT services firms to expand market presence while larger competitors like TCS lost 65 basis points ([The Hindu Business Line](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/sequential-market-share-gains-mask-deeper-yearly-slide-for-indian-it/article70349573.ece)).

**Stock Performance**: Coforge shares gained up to 31% since October as part of the IT sector recovery, with the stock trading at Rs 1,800 and maintaining a market capitalization of Rs 60,000 crore ([Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indias-ai-losers-just-made-investors-richer-by-rs-2-6-lakh-crore-nobody-saw-the-boom-coming/articleshow/125554826.cms), [Economic Times](https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/motilal-oswals-top-10-small-midcap-picks-that-can-deliver-strong-eps-by-fy28-how-many-do-you-own/stong-outlook/slideshow/125428331.cms)).

**Market Recognition**: Coforge was listed among 18 key players in the AI orchestration market, which is projected to grow from $11.02 billion in 2025 to $30.23 billion by 2030, alongside major technology vendors including IBM, AWS, Microsoft, and SAP ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/11/21/3192586/28124/en/AI-Orchestration-Global-Forecast-Report-2025-Market-to-Reach-30-23-Billion-by-2030-Driven-by-Demand-for-Unified-Governance-Compliance-Frameworks-and-Audit-Ready-Automation-Layers.html)).

## Market Context

Coforge's performance occurred against a challenging backdrop for Indian IT services, where the sector faced a 30% decline in effort-based billing and structural headwinds affecting traditional revenue models. While the top six Indian IT firms saw overall market share decline as transformation budgets moved to global players like Accenture and EPAM, Coforge bucked this trend by gaining market share annually. The company benefited from the broader IT sector recovery that began in October, driven by Federal Reserve rate cut expectations and a shift in investor sentiment away from AI-heavy investments toward traditional IT services companies. The sector is positioned for potential AI services inflection by mid-2026, with stable deal pipelines and improving technology budgets expected in FY26.
