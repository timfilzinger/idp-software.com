## News Review for coforge

# Coforge Comprehensive News Review

## Executive Summary

Coforge completed its largest acquisition to date, purchasing US-based AI engineering firm Encora for $2.35 billion in an all-stock transaction that transforms the company into a $2.5 billion IT services platform focused on AI-led capabilities ([source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/coforge-shares-in-focus-on-announcing-2-35-billion-acquisition-of-ai-firm-encora/articleshow/126222690.cms)). The deal, structured as a share swap at Rs 1,815.91 per share representing an 8.5% premium, involves 21% equity dilution and positions Coforge to generate $2 billion in AI-led services revenue by FY27 while expanding its presence in North America and Latin America ([source](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/coforge-shares-in-focus-on-mega-235-billion-encora-acquisition-plan)). Despite the strategic merit of the acquisition, which strengthens capabilities in healthcare and high-tech verticals while adding approximately 30% to current revenue run rate, market reception remained cautious with shares declining following the announcement ([source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/encora-buyout-widens-healthcare-high-tech-play-for-coforge-rahul-jain/articleshow/126225582.cms)). Separately, investment firm Motilal Oswal named Coforge among its top IT sector picks for 2026 with a buy rating and Rs 2,500 target price representing 51% upside potential, citing the company's positioning to benefit from AI-led demand revival as enterprises shift from pilot programs to scaled deployments ([source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/motilal-oswal-sees-ai-led-revival-in-it-sector-in-2026-names-4-top-stock-picks-with-up-to-51-upside/articleshow/126302446.cms)).

## Key Developments

**Major Acquisition**: Coforge acquired Encora for $2.35 billion enterprise value through an all-stock transaction, marking one of the largest acquisitions by an Indian IT services company ([source](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/forward-looking-deal-market-veteran-on-coforges-235-billion-encora-acquisition)). The deal includes $1.89 billion in equity shares issued at Rs 1,815.91 per share and up to $550 million for debt retirement, with transaction closure expected in Q1 FY27 ([source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/coforge-shares-rally-over-2-after-2-35-billion-encora-deal-should-investors-buy-the-stock-now/articleshow/126225000.cms)).

**Strategic Positioning**: The acquisition transforms Coforge from a traditional outsourcing firm to an AI-native engineering powerhouse, adding $600 million in revenue base and enhancing capabilities in AI-led engineering, cloud, and data services ([source](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/stock-markets/coforge-gains-085-as-analysts-weigh-235-billion-encora-acquisition/article70448447.ece)).

**Financial Projections**: The combined entity expects to generate $2 billion in annual revenue by March 2027, with North America business projected to grow 50% to $1.4 billion and overall EBIT margins targeting 14% ([source](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/coforge-shares-in-focus-on-mega-235-billion-encora-acquisition-plan)).

**Analyst Coverage**: Motilal Oswal set a Rs 2,500 target price with 51% upside potential, while multiple brokerages including Morgan Stanley, Jefferies, and Dolat Capital maintained buy ratings despite near-term dilution concerns ([source](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/how-brokerages-are-viewing-coforge-after-landmark-encora-deal-check-target-price-buy-sell-share-price)).

## Market Context

The Encora acquisition positions Coforge to capitalize on the broader industry shift where Fortune 2000 companies are pivoting from AI pilot programs to scaled implementations, with traditional digital services becoming commoditized ([source](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/forward-looking-deal-market-veteran-on-coforges-235-billion-encora-acquisition)). The transaction occurs amid a wave of AI-led acquisitions worth $3 billion in Q4 2025 across the Indian IT sector, with Coforge's deal representing 78% of the total value ([source](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/tcs-infosys-hcltech-wipro-coforge-in-focus-as-indian-it-plays-catch-up-to-artificial-intelligence)). The acquisition benefits from revised foreign exchange rules that now allow overseas shareholders to indirectly hold equity in Indian acquiring companies, making Coforge among the first to leverage this regulatory change ([source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/ma-activity-set-to-remain-strong-in-2026-after-104-billion-domestic-consolidation-in-2025/articleshow/126271672.cms)).

## Notable Quotes

**Trip Chowdhry, Managing Director - Equity Research, Global Equities**: "With this acquisition, the customer is putting a bet and engaging with those IT services companies who have a very solid roadmap of providing AI services. If this acquisition was not there, Coforge would not be in any conversation with the customer in 2026. So, it is also very timely." ([source](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/forward-looking-deal-market-veteran-on-coforges-235-billion-encora-acquisition))

**Ravi Menon, IT Services Analyst at Macquarie Capital**: "This is much bigger than what I think anyone expected them to do... I don't think midcap companies will acquire something so large. I would expect more sort of tuck-in acquisitions from them." ([source](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/tcs-infosys-hcltech-wipro-coforge-in-focus-as-indian-it-plays-catch-up-to-artificial-intelligence))

**Rahul Jain, Dolat Capital**: "This is a significant transaction from a size perspective and adds about 30% plus to the current run rate of revenue. Their historical strong organic growth and consistent bold step on the M&A side as well has helped them scale much faster." ([source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/encora-buyout-widens-healthcare-high-tech-play-for-coforge-rahul-jain/articleshow/126225582.cms))

## Strategic Implications

The Encora acquisition represents a transformative strategic bet that positions Coforge to compete with larger IT firms through AI capabilities rather than traditional organic scaling methods, though success depends on executing integration and realizing synergies to achieve EPS accretion by FY27 ([source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/coforgeencora-deal-likely-to-be-long-term-positive-analysts/articleshow/126241895.cms)). The deal establishes Coforge as an early adopter of new regulatory frameworks for international expansion while creating sustainable growth drivers in high-growth segments like healthcare and high-tech verticals ([source](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/how-brokerages-are-viewing-coforge-after-landmark-encora-deal-check-target-price-buy-sell-share-price)). However, the company faces execution risks in the current selective technology spending environment, with the acquisition's success contingent on maintaining balance-sheet discipline and achieving projected revenue synergies while managing the integration of two companies with different growth profiles ([source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/encora-buyout-widens-healthcare-high-tech-play-for-coforge-rahul-jain/articleshow/126225582.cms)).

**Source:** [View Full Article](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/motilal-oswal-sees-ai-led-revival-in-it-sector-in-2026-names-4-top-stock-picks-with-up-to-51-upside/articleshow/126302446.cms)

## Summary

Motilal Oswal named Coforge as a top IT sector pick for 2026 with a buy rating and Rs 2,500 target price representing 51% upside potential, the highest among four selected stocks. The brokerage expects 3% quarter-on-quarter revenue growth despite seasonal furloughs, with the Sabre deal already fully ramped up. However, EBIT margins are projected to decline 70 basis points due to wage hikes effective October 1, 2025. Coforge aims to close 20 large deals in FY26 compared to 14 in FY25, with BFS and insurance segments contributing over half of company revenue. The recommendation comes amid broader expectations for AI-led demand revival in 2026 as enterprises shift from AI pilots to scaled deployments.

## Summary

Coforge has been positioned among promising mid-tier IT companies for 2026 alongside Persistent Systems, as the IT sector prepares for continued AI-driven client conversations and improved project ramp-up rates. The company operates in an environment where AI partnerships are becoming central to client engagement, with industry-wide trends showing automation supporting operating margins while potentially constraining top-line growth. This analyst recognition suggests market confidence in Coforge's mid-tier positioning as the sector navigates AI adoption and maintains higher employee utilization rates with limited hiring.

## Summary

Coforge has proposed a $2.3 billion acquisition of Encora, marking one of the first major transactions to benefit from India's revised foreign exchange rules that now allow overseas shareholders to indirectly hold equity in Indian acquiring companies. This regulatory change, which previously blocked non-cash overseas acquisitions by Indian firms, positions Coforge as an early adopter of the new framework and represents a major international expansion move that could enhance its competitive position in the global IT services market.
