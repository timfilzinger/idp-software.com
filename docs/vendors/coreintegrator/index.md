## Use Cases

### Accounts Payable Automation

Finance departments deploy CoreIntegrator to automate invoice processing from capture through payment. The system receives invoices via email, scan, or upload, extracts header and line-item data using [OCR](../../capabilities/ocr/index.md), validates information against purchase orders and vendor records, and routes documents through approval workflows based on configurable business rules. Integration with ERP systems enables automatic posting of approved invoices for payment processing.

### Contract Approval Management

Organizations manage contract lifecycle workflows from request through execution. The platform routes contract documents through customized approval chains, maintains version history, sends automated deadline notifications, and stores executed contracts with searchable metadata. Audit trails track all document activities for compliance requirements.
