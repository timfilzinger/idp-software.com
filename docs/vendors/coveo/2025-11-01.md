## News Review for coveo

# Coveo Solutions Inc. - Comprehensive News Review

## Executive Summary

Coveo Solutions Inc. demonstrated strong operational performance in Q2 2026 with 17% subscription revenue growth and 150% generative AI customer growth, while facing analyst downgrades from National Bank and price target reductions from RBC Capital (C$2) and BMO Capital (C$1). The Quebec City-based AI platform company achieved a major enterprise validation through its deployment at SAP, delivering 80% self-service success rates and €186 million in cost avoidance across 300 million cloud subscribers, while also powering Manulife's wealth management search engine with 99.6% accuracy. Despite positive momentum in AI solutions, the company adjusted full-year revenue guidance following a Salesforce contract renegotiation, though RBC Capital maintains Coveo on its small-cap conviction list with a $12 price target, citing strong commerce vertical momentum through partnerships with SAP, Shopify, and Salesforce. Executive Chairman Louis Têtu's appointment to Canada's AI Strategy Task Force positions the company as a recognized leader in AI commercialization, while Coveo's consumer research showing 70% acceptance of AI-guided shopping validates the market opportunity for its retail solutions.

## Key Developments

**Financial Performance**: Coveo reported Q2 2026 results showing 17% subscription revenue growth, the highest rate in nearly five quarters, alongside 150% year-over-year growth in generative AI customer and revenue metrics ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coveo-solutions-inc-cvosf-q2-030751546.html)). The company maintains $108 million in cash with no debt but adjusted full-year revenue guidance due to a renegotiated Salesforce contract.

**Major Enterprise Deployments**: SAP's implementation of Coveo's AI-powered search platform achieved 80% self-service success rates and €186 million in cost avoidance, processing 11.2 million documents across 47 sources for over 300 million cloud subscribers ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maribellopez/2025/10/05/ai-cuts-sap-support-costs-by-186m-in-one-year-with-coveo/)). Separately, Manulife deployed Coveo's search engine achieving 99.6% accuracy and doubling digital engagement in their wealth management division ([Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/forresters-2025-enterprise-architecture-award-winner-and-finalists-for-north-america/)).

**Strategic Partnerships**: RBC Capital highlighted Coveo's commerce momentum through partnerships with SAP, Shopify, and Salesforce, maintaining the company on its small-cap conviction list ([Financial Post](https://financialpost.com/investing/top-tsx-performer-up-190-gains-keep)).

**Leadership Recognition**: Executive Chairman Louis Têtu was appointed to the Government of Canada's AI Strategy Task Force, focusing on AI commercialization during a 30-day consultation period from October 1-31, 2025 ([Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2025/09/government-of-canada-launches-ai-strategy-task-force-and-public-engagement-on-the-development-of-the-next-ai-strategy.html)).

## Market Context

Coveo operates in a rapidly evolving AI services market where enterprise AI spending surged eight-fold in 2024, though 95% of generative AI pilots fail to reach production. The company's successful large-scale deployments at SAP and Manulife differentiate it from failed implementations by demonstrating concrete business outcomes. Consumer acceptance of AI shopping tools varies widely across studies, with Coveo's research showing 70% acceptance rates for generative AI guidance ([Retail Dive](https://www.retaildive.com/news/consumers-ai-shopping-tools-holidays-retail/801800/)), validating the market opportunity for AI-powered retail experiences as companies like Amazon launch competing tools ([Customer Experience Dive](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/amazon-ai-tool-help-me-decide/803673/)).

## Notable Quotes

**Michelle Lewis-Miller, Head of Digital Experience and Voice of Customer for Customer Support at SAP**: "When we piloted Relevance Generative Answering in Concur, it went so well it was shocking. We saw such a huge decrease in case submission that helped us tremendously in keeping up with business growth" ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maribellopez/2025/10/05/ai-cuts-sap-support-costs-by-186m-in-one-year-with-coveo/)).

**Peter Treiber, RBC analyst**: "Coveo is seeing strong momentum in the commerce vertical, fuelled by partnerships with SAP (SE), Shopify (Inc.), and Salesforce (Inc.)" and "additional high-profile customer wins in commerce are likely catalysts for the stock, in our view" ([Financial Post](https://financialpost.com/investing/top-tsx-performer-up-190-gains-keep)).

**Unidentified Coveo Executive**: "We are an AI platform company with multiple models that we build and maintain ourselves, focusing on relevance. We also incorporate large language models when necessary. Our platform is designed for interoperability, allowing us to use our own models or leverage best-of-breed external models depending on the use case" ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coveo-solutions-inc-cvosf-q2-030751546.html)).

## Strategic Implications

Coveo's hybrid AI platform strategy combining proprietary relevance models with external large language models positions the company to adapt to the evolving AI landscape while maintaining competitive differentiation. The SAP success story provides a compelling reference case for enterprise customers, demonstrating measurable ROI at scale in a market where most AI pilots fail. However, the Salesforce contract renegotiation highlights dependency risks with large clients, while analyst downgrades suggest market concerns about growth sustainability. The company's partnership-driven approach in commerce, validated by strong generative AI adoption metrics, appears well-positioned to capitalize on increasing enterprise demand for AI-powered search and personalization solutions. Executive leadership involvement in Canadian AI policy development may provide strategic advantages in government relations and early insight into national AI initiatives.
