## Use Cases

### Financial Services Document Archiving

Banks archive customer account documentation, loan files, and compliance records for regulatory retention periods. Docbyte Vault processes incoming documents through the digital mailroom, classifies content by document type and retention schedule, and stores files in ISO 14721-compliant archives. Qualified trust services validate document authenticity and preserve signature validity throughout multi-decade retention periods.

### Insurance Claims Processing

Insurance carriers receive claims documentation via email, portal uploads, and scanned mail. Docbyte's digital mailroom ingests documents from all channels, extracts claim numbers and policy information, and routes files to claims adjusters. Machine learning classification identifies document types including medical records, police reports, and repair estimates without manual sorting.

### Pharmaceutical Quality Documentation

Life sciences companies maintain batch records, quality control documentation, and validation reports for FDA compliance. Docbyte processes manufacturing documents, extracts batch identifiers and test results, and archives records with tamper-evident preservation. The platform maintains audit trails demonstrating document integrity from creation through the required retention period.
