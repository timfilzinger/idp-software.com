# DocSend

DocSend is a secure document sharing and analytics platform, acquired by Dropbox in 2021, that enables businesses to share, track, and control access to documents through encrypted links.

## Overview

DocSend, founded in 2013 by Russ Heddleston, Dave Koslow, and Tony Cassanego in San Francisco, provides document sharing and engagement tracking software primarily for startups, venture capitalists, sales teams, and business development professionals. Dropbox acquired DocSend in March 2021 for $165 million to integrate document sharing, tracking, and analytics capabilities into its content collaboration ecosystem.

The platform serves over 17,000 customers (as of acquisition), offering granular analytics on document engagement including page-by-page viewing statistics, time spent, and recipient behavior. DocSend focuses on secure content distribution with features including password protection, expiration dates, watermarking, and access revocation for shared documents.

## Key Features

- **Secure Link Sharing**: Encrypted document links with access controls and expiration dates
- **Engagement Analytics**: Page-by-page viewing statistics, time spent per page, and recipient interaction tracking
- **Permission Management**: Password protection, watermarking, NDA requirements, and access revocation
- **Customizable Spaces**: Branded document rooms for client and stakeholder collaboration
- **Dropbox Integration**: Seamless connection with Dropbox file storage and organization

## Use Cases

### Startup Fundraising

Founders share pitch decks and financial projections with investors through DocSend, tracking which slides receive the most attention and how long investors spend reviewing materials. Analytics reveal investor interest levels and engagement patterns, enabling founders to follow up strategically based on viewing behavior and identify slides requiring revision.

### Sales Enablement

Sales teams distribute proposals, contracts, and product materials to prospects while monitoring engagement. Representatives identify which prospects have reviewed documents, which sections generate the most interest, and when to follow up based on viewing activity. Access controls enable revoking document access after deal closure or expiration dates.

### Deal Rooms

Venture capital firms and M&A advisors create secure deal rooms containing due diligence materials, financial statements, and legal documents. Stakeholders access organized document collections with granular permissions, while administrators track who viewed which documents and when, maintaining comprehensive audit trails for compliance.
