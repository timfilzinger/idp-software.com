## News Review for edgeverve

# EdgeVerve Systems News Review

## Executive Summary

EdgeVerve Systems has gained market recognition through inclusion in two major industry research reports, positioning the company among key players in both the AI-enabled RPA market and core banking software sector. The company was identified as one of approximately 25 key players in the AI in RPA market, which is projected to grow by USD 14.28 billion between 2024 and 2029 with a 33% CAGR ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/08/3163244/28124/en/AI-in-RPA-Robotic-Process-Automation-Market-2025-2029-Key-Insights-for-Customer-Service-Automation-Finance-Accounting-IT-Infrastructure-Management-Human-Resources-and-Other-Applica.html)), while simultaneously being listed among 20 key players in the core banking software market through its Finacle platform, operating in a sector expected to grow from USD 14.85 billion in 2024 to USD 38.21 billion by 2032 at a 12.63% CAGR ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/02/3160446/0/en/Core-Banking-Software-Market-Size-to-Hit-USD-38-21-Billion-by-2032-Surging-Mobile-Banking-and-Omnichannel-Platforms-Aid-Growth-Globally-SNS-Insider.html)). These analyst recognitions place EdgeVerve alongside established competitors including UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Microsoft in the RPA space, and Oracle, Temenos, FIS, and Finastra in core banking software, though no specific product developments, strategic initiatives, or executive commentary were detailed in either report.

## Key Developments

No specific product launches, strategic partnerships, financial performance updates, or leadership changes were reported for EdgeVerve Systems during this period. The developments were limited to market research recognition across two industry segments.

## Market Context

EdgeVerve operates in two rapidly expanding technology markets. The AI in RPA market is experiencing growth driven by generative AI adoption, hyperautomation needs, and the emergence of agentic automation, while the core banking software market is expanding due to increasing demand for centralized financial systems and real-time transaction processing capabilities. Both markets represent competitive landscapes with established technology providers, requiring continued innovation and differentiation strategies for sustained market position.

## Strategic Implications

The dual market recognition positions EdgeVerve as a player in both automation and financial technology sectors, providing validation of the company's market presence. However, operating alongside established competitors like Microsoft, Oracle, and specialized automation providers requires clear differentiation strategies. The strong growth projections in both markets - 33% CAGR for AI in RPA and 12.63% CAGR for core banking software - present expansion opportunities, though the company will need to demonstrate specific competitive advantages to capitalize on these market dynamics and maintain relevance against well-funded competitors.
