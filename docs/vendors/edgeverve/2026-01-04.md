# EdgeVerve News Review

## Executive Summary

EdgeVerve demonstrated strategic positioning across multiple high-growth technology markets during this period, with CTO Arvind Rao publishing thought leadership on Agentic AI for Global Business Services transformation while the company maintained recognition in both the rapidly expanding RPA market and emerging contract intelligence sector. The company's AssistEdge platform operates within a RPA market projected to grow from $35.27 billion in 2026 to $247.34 billion by 2035, where EdgeVerve holds a Tier 2 position alongside vendors like KOFAX and FPT Software, capturing a portion of the 25-30% combined market share for established players. Simultaneously, EdgeVerve received market recognition in the contract intelligence space, which is projected to grow from $1.1 billion in 2024 to $7.2 billion by 2033, positioning the Infosys subsidiary alongside established players like DocuSign and Icertis in this AI-driven document processing sector.

## Key Developments

**Product Platform Enhancement**: The company's Agentic AI platform for GBS incorporates a platform-centric approach with Responsible AI foundations, end-to-end visibility, human oversight frameworks, composable architectures, federated AI governance, and digital twins of operations, enabling real-time decision making and enterprise-wide responsiveness while maintaining compliance ([source](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/comment/agentic-gbs-next-operating-system-intelligent-enterprises/)).

## Market Context

EdgeVerve operates across multiple converging automation markets experiencing substantial growth trajectories. The RPA market, where EdgeVerve's AssistEdge platform competes, is projected to expand at a 24.20% CAGR, with the BFSI sector leading adoption at 36.52% market share, aligning with EdgeVerve's traditional financial services strength ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/16/3206126/0/en/Robotic-Process-Automation-RPA-Market-Size-Expands-from-USD-35-27-Bn-in-2026-to-USD-247-34-Bn-by-2035-Fueled-by-AI-Powered-Automation-and-Digitalization.html)). The contract intelligence market represents another high-growth opportunity with a 23.07% CAGR, driven by AI automation and document processing needs. The integration of AI and machine learning capabilities is becoming standard across both markets, creating pressure for traditional rule-based automation vendors to develop cognitive capabilities.

## Notable Quotes

**Arvind Rao, CTO, EdgeVerve**: "Agentic AI doesn't just improve processes. It unlocks new possibilities." This statement summarizes EdgeVerve's value proposition for moving beyond traditional process improvement to fundamental business transformation ([source](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/comment/agentic-gbs-next-operating-system-intelligent-enterprises/)).

## Strategic Implications

EdgeVerve's strategic positioning reflects a calculated evolution from traditional RPA vendor to enterprise transformation partner, leveraging its Infosys backing to compete in multiple high-growth markets simultaneously. The company's emphasis on Agentic AI and Responsible AI foundations positions it to address enterprise concerns about autonomous decision-making while differentiating from rule-based competitors. However, EdgeVerve faces intensifying competition from well-funded players like Ironclad in contract intelligence and established RPA leaders like UiPath and Automation Anywhere. The company's success will depend on its ability to execute its platform-centric vision while maintaining competitive positioning across multiple market segments that are attracting increased investment and competition.
