## Overview

Ephesoft, founded in 2010, developed cloud-native intelligent document processing technology for converting unstructured documents into structured data. Tungsten Automation (formerly Kofax) acquired Ephesoft in August 2022 to integrate its document processing capabilities into Tungsten's broader intelligent automation platform. At acquisition, Ephesoft reported year-over-year growth exceeding 30%.

The platform, now branded as Tungsten Transact, serves organizations across financial services, healthcare, government, insurance, and manufacturing sectors. The software uses supervised and unsupervised machine learning to automatically classify documents, extract data, and route information to business systems with minimal template configuration required.

## Key Features

- **[Intelligent Document Capture](../../capabilities/ocr/index.md)**: Multi-engine OCR processing digital and paper documents across 100+ languages
- **[ML-Based Classification](../../capabilities/classification/index.md)**: Automatic document categorization using supervised and unsupervised learning models
- **[Data Extraction](../../capabilities/extraction/index.md)**: Field-level information capture from structured and unstructured documents
- **Handwriting Recognition**: ICR technology for processing handwritten forms and documents
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Scalable deployment in cloud environments with hybrid and on-premise options
- **Minimal Training Requirements**: Document recognition from as few as one sample document
- **Multi-Channel Capture**: Processing from scanners, email, web portals, and mobile devices
- **ERP/ECM Integration**: Connections to major enterprise content and business systems

## Use Cases

### Mortgage Loan Processing

Financial institutions process loan applications and supporting documents including tax returns, bank statements, and property appraisals. The system classifies over 50 document types common in mortgage packages, extracts borrower information and property details, validates data against business rules, and integrates with loan origination systems for automated applicant record population.

### Healthcare Records Management

Healthcare providers digitize patient medical records and administrative documents through automated capture of registration forms, insurance cards, referrals, lab results, and clinical notes. Machine learning algorithms classify documents and extract patient demographics, insurance details, medical record numbers, and diagnostic codes for integration with EHR and practice management systems.
