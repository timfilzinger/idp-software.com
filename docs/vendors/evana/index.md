AI-powered document classification automatically organizes incoming documentation by property, document type, and relevance without requiring manual filing or tagging. Advanced search capabilities enable users to quickly locate specific information across the entire portfolio based on property characteristics, document content, dates, or other parameters. Information extraction creates structured data from documents that can be used for portfolio analysis, reporting, and decision-making without manual data entry.
