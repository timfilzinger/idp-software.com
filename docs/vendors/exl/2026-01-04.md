## Executive Summary

EXL Services demonstrated continued momentum across multiple business dimensions during December 2025, highlighted by the launch of two AI-powered data solutions through Databricks' GenAI Partner Accelerator program and the completion of its LifePRO Digital Suite migration to AWS cloud infrastructure.

## Strategic Implications

EXL's recent developments demonstrate a coordinated strategy to strengthen its position as an AI-native data and technology services provider. The launch of EXLdata.ai and Code Harbor establishes the company as a serious competitor in the legacy modernization market, while the AWS migration of LifePRO Digital Suite enhances its cloud-native capabilities for insurance clients. The internal promotion of Jaggi signals leadership continuity and institutional knowledge retention in the critical insurance vertical. The share repurchase program, combined with continued talent acquisition and workplace recognition, suggests management confidence in the company's growth trajectory while maintaining focus on human capital development. These moves collectively position EXL to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-powered data transformation services in regulated industries, though the company faces intensifying competition from 24+ partners in the Databricks ecosystem alone.
