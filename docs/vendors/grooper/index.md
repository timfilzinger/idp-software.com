## Overview

Grooper is developed by BIS, combining multiple OCR engines, natural language processing, and machine learning for document [classification](../../capabilities/classification/index.md) and [data extraction](../../capabilities/extraction/index.md). The platform uses a patented multi-pass OCR approach, where recognized text is removed between passes to reduce visual interference. Grooper supports 268 languages and 523 regional cultures with automatic language detection for dates, currency, and numeric formats.

The platform serves healthcare providers, financial institutions, oil and gas companies, government agencies, and educational organizations. Grooper processes structured documents like invoices, semi-structured forms like division orders, and unstructured content including leases and medical records. BIS has developed Grooper over 35 years at its Oklahoma headquarters, providing the software with integration and deployment services for enterprise implementations.

## Key Features

- **Patented Multi-Pass OCR**: Two U.S. patents (10,740,638 and 10,679,089) for iterative text recognition that removes captured text between passes to improve accuracy on subsequent runs
- **Multi-Engine OCR**: Synthesizes results from multiple OCR engines to achieve near-perfect accuracy, with trainable OCR for custom fonts
- **Intelligent Character Recognition**: Recognizes handwritten text using Microsoft Azure and neural networks that learn from new handwriting styles
- **Advanced Image Processing**: Over 70 image processing commands including bound region detection, segment reprocessing, cellular validation for multi-column layouts, and font pitch detection
- **RAG-Enabled AI Assistant**: Retrieval-augmented generation links internal and external data sources for natural language queries across document repositories and databases
- **No-Code Configuration**: Visual automation setup without programming requirements
- **Grooper xChange**: Marketplace for pre-built integrations and processing modules
- **CMIS Connectivity**: Extracts images from enterprise content management systems with document identification capabilities

## Use Cases

### Financial Document Processing

Banks and lending institutions use Grooper to process checks with mixed fonts, handwriting, and security backgrounds. The multi-pass OCR approach captures account numbers, routing information, and written amounts by removing recognized text between passes. Grooper validates data completeness across loan applications and account opening documents, integrating with core banking systems for straight-through processing while routing exceptions for manual review.

### Healthcare Records Digitization

Healthcare organizations process patient records, insurance claims, and medical correspondence containing typed clinical notes and handwritten physician entries. Grooper's ICR capabilities extract information from handwritten forms while maintaining audit trails for HIPAA compliance. The RAG-enabled AI assistant allows clinicians to query patient document history using natural language, searching across document repositories and integrated databases.

### Oil and Gas Document Processing

Energy companies process leases, revenue statements, and division orders with varied layouts and structures. Grooper handles unstructured lease agreements, tabular revenue data, and semi-structured division orders within single workflows. The cellular validation feature divides multi-column layouts into grids for independent processing, achieving performance improvements up to 90% for document-intensive operations.
