## News Review for hcltech

# HCLTech News Review

## Executive Summary

HCLTech executed an aggressive $400 million acquisition strategy within a single week in December 2024, purchasing three companies to strengthen its AI and data analytics capabilities: Jaspersoft for $240 million, HPE's Telco Solutions business for $160 million, and Belgian AI startup Wobby for $5.3 million ([source](https://www.livemint.com/companies/hcltech-400-million-acquisitions-ai-offerings-data-offerings-jaspersoft-wobby-hpe-telecom-solutions-11766463875927.html)). This acquisition spree, representing the company's largest spending since March 2022, positions HCLTech to compete in AI-led, platform-centric deals while the company simultaneously pursued a counter-trend hiring strategy, doubling fresher recruitment to 12,000 graduates in FY26 against industry-wide reductions ([source](https://www.livemint.com/companies/infosys-first-large-it-outsourcer-fewer-fresher-hiring-11766985526621.html)). The company achieved 4.3% revenue growth to $13.84 billion in FY25, outperforming larger competitors TCS and Infosys, while establishing itself as one of the first large systems integrators to partner with OpenAI ([source](https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/12/26/1756219/indian-it-was-supposed-to-die-from-ai-instead-its-billing-for-the-cleanup)).

## Key Developments

**Strategic Acquisitions**: HCLTech completed three major acquisitions totaling $400 million in cash within one week. The company acquired Jaspersoft from Cloud Software Group for $240 million to enhance business intelligence capabilities ([source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/information-tech/hclsoftware-to-acquire-business-intelligence-platform-jaspersoft-for-240-million/articleshow/126134367.cms)), purchased HPE's Telco Solutions business for $160 million to strengthen telecommunications and AI-led network propositions ([source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/information-tech/hcltech-to-acquire-telco-solutions-business-from-hpe-to-strengthen-engineering-ai-led-network-propositions/article70414284.ece)), and acquired Belgian startup Wobby for $5.3 million to add agentic AI capabilities for data warehouses ([source](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/hcltechs-software-arm-to-acquire-antwerp-based-startup-wobby-for-5-2-million-11766425197497.html)).

**Workforce Strategy**: HCLTech pursued an aggressive counter-trend hiring approach, adding 5,196 fresh graduates in Q2 and planning to recruit approximately 12,000 freshers in FY26, more than double the previous year's intake, while industry peers like Infosys reduced entry-level hiring due to automation concerns ([source](https://www.livemint.com/companies/infosys-first-large-it-outsourcer-fewer-fresher-hiring-11766985526621.html)).

**Financial Performance**: The company reported $13.84 billion in revenue for FY25 with 4.3% growth, exceeding the performance of larger competitors TCS (3.8%) and Infosys (3.9%) ([source](https://www.livemint.com/companies/indian-it-s-m-a-spend-a-record-high-of-4-3-billion-in-2025-11766918672527.html)).

**Strategic Partnerships**: HCLTech established itself as one of the first large systems integrators to form a partnership with OpenAI, providing first-mover advantage in AI services implementation ([source](https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/12/26/1756219/indian-it-was-supposed-to-die-from-ai-instead-its-billing-for-the-cleanup)).

## Market Context

HCLTech's acquisition strategy aligns with the broader Indian IT industry's record $4.3 billion spending on acquisitions in FY25, as companies shift from shareholder payouts to capability building in AI and cloud technologies. The company's aggressive fresher hiring strategy contrasts sharply with industry trends, as 83% of stakeholders expect AI to meaningfully change business models by 2026, leading most competitors to reduce campus recruitment. The acquisitions position HCLTech to capture preparatory AI work as enterprises prepare for large-scale AI deployment, with less than 15% of organizations currently meaningfully deploying generative AI, creating opportunities for 2-3 years of preparatory services including data cleanup, cloud migration, and system integration.

## Notable Quotes

**Marc Potter, CEO of Actian & Portfolio General Manager of HCLSoftware's Data & AI division**: "As GenAI adoption accelerates, our customers want business intelligence solutions that can deliver consistent analytics and reports and offer flexibility to fully own the analytics experience" ([source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/information-tech/hclsoftware-to-acquire-business-intelligence-platform-jaspersoft-for-240-million/articleshow/126134367.cms)).

**Ramachandran Sundararajan, Chief People Officer of HCLTech**: "We started the year with a plan that we will do a significantly higher fresher addition this year compared to last year. If you look at what you have done during H1, that's almost 92% of what we did in the entire year last year" ([source](https://www.livemint.com/companies/infosys-first-large-it-outsourcer-fewer-fresher-hiring-11766985526621.html)).

**Anil Ganjoo, Chief Growth Officer and Global Head of TMT at HCLTech**: "We are very excited about the opportunity ahead, as HCLTech is uniquely positioned to empower CSPs to realize their transformation into true technology companies--advancing the shift from telcos to techcos" ([source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/information-tech/hcltech-to-acquire-telco-solutions-business-from-hpe-to-strengthen-engineering-ai-led-network-propositions/article70414284.ece)).

**Phil Fersht, CEO of HFS Research**: "The pace matters because it shows management believes the window to reposition for AI-led, platform-centric deals is now, not over the next few years. These are targeted capability buys, not scale acquisitions, aimed at sharpening differentiation in analytics, integration, and enterprise data workflows" ([source](https://www.livemint.com/companies/hcltech-400-million-acquisitions-ai-offerings-data-offerings-jaspersoft-wobby-hpe-telecom-solutions-11766463875927.html)).

## Strategic Implications

HCLTech's rapid acquisition pace and counter-trend hiring strategy demonstrate management's conviction that the window for AI transformation is immediate rather than gradual. The targeted capability acquisitions in business intelligence, agentic AI, and telecommunications position the company to compete in higher-value, IP-led services while building a larger talent pipeline as competitors face capacity constraints. The company's willingness to accept 100 basis points margin reduction while investing in AI capabilities indicates a strategic shift from traditional services to software-driven solutions. The OpenAI partnership provides competitive differentiation in AI services implementation, while the aggressive fresher hiring may enable HCLTech to capture market opportunities as demand recovers and competitors face talent shortages. However, analysts note these acquisitions represent portfolio adjustments rather than transformative growth drivers, as deal sizes remain small relative to HCLTech's scale and cannot fully offset weak discretionary spending in the current market environment.

## Summary

HCLTech scaled back campus hiring as part of broader workforce adjustments across Indian IT services companies, including TCS, Infosys, and Wipro, following large-scale job cuts. This move aligns with industry expectations that AI adoption will reshape business models in 2026, with 83% of surveyed stakeholders anticipating AI to meaningfully change their operations. The hiring reduction reflects the IT services sector's response to evolving market demands as AI automation affects traditional service delivery models.

**Source:** [View Full Article](https://www.livemint.com/companies/infosys-first-large-it-outsourcer-fewer-fresher-hiring-11766985526621.html)

## Summary

HCLTech is pursuing a counter-trend strategy by doubling its fresher hiring to 12,000 graduates in FY26, adding 5,196 new graduates in Q2 alone, while industry leader Infosys announces plans to reduce entry-level hiring due to automation and productivity gains. Chief people officer Ramachandran Sundararajan confirmed the company is on track with its aggressive hiring plan, having already achieved 92% of last year's full-year fresher additions in just the first half. This positioning differentiates HCLTech from competitors who are focusing on productivity improvements over headcount growth, potentially giving the company a talent acquisition advantage and capacity for future market expansion as it achieved 5.6% growth, outpacing most peers.

## Executive Insights

**Ramachandran Sundararajan, chief people officer of HCLTech**

> "We started the year with a plan that we will do a significantly higher fresher addition this year compared to last year. If you look at what you have done during H1, that's almost 92% of what we did in the entire year last year. We are on track to do what we planned to do this year in terms of fresher relations."

### Article 9: HCLTech bets on targeted acquisitions as organic growth headwinds persist

**Source:** [View Full Article](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/hcltech-bets-on-targeted-acquisitions-as-organic-growth-headwinds-persist/article70430439.ece)

## Summary

HCLTech announced three acquisitions worth €404.5 million in Q3, acquiring Wobby BV's agentic AI platform (€4.5M), HPE's Telco Solutions business ($160M), and Jaspersoft analytics platform ($240M), with all deals expected to close in 2025. Industry analysts characterize this as a strategic response to enterprise buyers demanding specialized, outcome-driven solutions rather than broad capabilities, with clients showing less tolerance for gaps in specific expertise areas. While the acquisitions target high-growth AI and analytics capabilities that could improve margins over 12-24 months, analysts note they represent portfolio adjustments to protect market position rather than transformative growth drivers, as the deal sizes remain small relative to HCLTech's scale and cannot fully offset weak discretionary spending in the current demand environment.

## Executive Insights
