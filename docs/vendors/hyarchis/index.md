## Use Cases

### Financial Institution Onboarding

Banks and mortgage lenders use Hyarchis to automate customer onboarding by processing identity documents, financial statements, and compliance forms. The platform performs automated [document classification](../../capabilities/classification/index.md) and data extraction to populate KYC databases while conducting simultaneous PEP and sanctions checks. Integration with core banking systems enables straight-through processing for approved applications, while flagged cases route to compliance teams for manual review. The system maintains audit trails for regulatory reporting and supports continuous monitoring of existing customer relationships.

### Insurance Document Processing

Life insurance and pension fund administrators process policy applications, beneficiary forms, and claim documents through the Document Manager. The platform extracts policy numbers, coverage amounts, beneficiary details, and medical information from structured and semi-structured documents. Extracted data flows directly into policy administration systems like Keylane and Intrasurance, eliminating manual data entry. Document archives remain searchable and retrievable for claims processing and regulatory audits.
