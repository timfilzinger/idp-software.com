**Product Development:** The company continues to develop its AI-based RPA platform specializing in document processing and data extraction, focusing on intelligent automation solutions that handle complex documents requiring cognitive capabilities ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/16/3206126/0/en/Robotic-Process-Automation-RPA-Market-Size-Expands-from-USD-35-27-Bn-in-2026-to-USD-247-34-Bn-by-2035-Fueled-by-AI-Powered-Automation-and-Digitalization.html)).

## Market Context

HyperScience operates within the intelligent document processing segment of the broader RPA market, which is experiencing rapid expansion driven by AI and machine learning integration. The market's projected growth at a 24.20% CAGR through 2035 reflects increasing enterprise demand for cognitive automation capabilities beyond basic rule-based tasks. This trend toward intelligent automation aligns with HyperScience's AI-powered platform approach, as organizations seek solutions capable of processing complex documents and extracting data that requires natural language processing and predictive analytics capabilities ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/16/3206126/0/en/Robotic-Process-Automation-RPA-Market-Size-Expands-from-USD-35-27-Bn-in-2026-to-USD-247-34-Bn-by-2035-Fueled-by-AI-Powered-Automation-and-Digitalization.html)).

## Strategic Implications

The Series E funding provides HyperScience with resources to compete in an increasingly crowded RPA market while maintaining its specialized focus on AI-powered document processing. The company's positioning as a cognitive automation provider rather than a general RPA vendor differentiates it as the market evolves beyond traditional rule-based automation. The investment from Tiger Global Management indicates institutional confidence in HyperScience's approach to intelligent document processing, though the company faces intensifying competition as more players enter the AI-powered automation space. The funding enables continued platform development to maintain technological advantages in document processing capabilities that require advanced AI and machine learning integration ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/16/3206126/0/en/Robotic-Process-Automation-RPA-Market-Size-Expands-from-USD-35-27-Bn-in-2026-to-USD-247-34-Bn-by-2035-Fueled-by-AI-Powered-Automation-and-Digitalization.html)).
