## News Review for imanage

# iManage Business News Review

## Executive Summary

iManage demonstrated strategic positioning in the AI-driven legal technology market through multiple partnership integrations and customer wins during this period. The company secured UK law firm Seddons GSC as a customer for its cloud-native platform serving 150 users, with implementation underway and go-live scheduled for later 2025 ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/09/3163883/0/en/Seddons-GSC-Selects-iManage-to-Modernize-Document-and-Email-Management-with-Cloud-First-Approach.html)). The company expanded its AI ecosystem through technology partnerships with both Alexi's legal intelligence platform and Clio's Vincent AI platform, positioning itself as the foundational knowledge management layer for AI-enabled legal workflows ([Financial Post](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-wire-news-releases-pmn/alexi-announces-imanage-integration-to-streamline-legal-workflows), [LawNext](https://www.lawnext.com/2025/10/to-a-sometimes-shell-shocked-cliocon-audience-jack-newton-presented-clios-vision-for-a-new-era-of-ai-driven-legal-work.html)). Additionally, iManage participated in market research revealing that 45% of law firms are modifying their knowledge management approaches to support AI initiatives, with the company's executives positioning proper document governance as fundamental to AI success ([ABA Journal](https://www.abajournal.com/columns/article/midsize-law-firms-are-balancing-potential-and-pitfalls-in-charting-an-unpredictable-path-forward)).

## Key Developments

**Customer Wins**: Seddons GSC, a UK-based law firm, selected iManage's cloud-first platform for approximately 150 users, with implementation underway and go-live targeted for later 2025. The firm is also piloting iManage's Ask iManage AI assistant to streamline information retrieval.

**Strategic Partnerships**: iManage formed technology partnerships with Alexi to integrate the legal intelligence platform directly into iManage's knowledge work platform, and with Clio's Vincent AI platform as part of Clio's enterprise suite targeting large law firms with 1,000+ lawyers.

**Product Enhancements**: The Ask iManage AI assistant is being piloted by customers, designed to streamline information retrieval and reduce time spent on routine tasks.

**Market Research Participation**: iManage participated in research showing 45% of law firms are changing knowledge management approaches to provide better data for large language models.

## Market Context

These developments position iManage within the broader trend of legal technology convergence, where document management systems are becoming integration points for AI-driven platforms rather than standalone solutions. The legal sector shows 63% adoption of generative AI despite 81% reporting fears about the technology, while in-house legal teams are adopting AI faster than law firms and increasingly requesting AI capabilities in vendor RFPs. iManage's strategy reflects the market's need for trusted document management platforms that can serve as the foundational layer for AI implementations while maintaining security and governance standards.

## Notable Quotes

**Paul Bower, AI Director at iManage**: "When law firms adopt AI, the real question isn't just what the technology can do – it's whether they can trust it. At iManage, we define this as AI Confidence– the ability to harness advanced AI with security, governance, and trust at its core. This partnership with Alexi complements our own AI-enabled capabilities while reflecting our open ecosystem approach, enabling firms to leverage specialized capabilities while maintaining the security and governance standards iManage is trusted to deliver." ([Financial Post](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-wire-news-releases-pmn/alexi-announces-imanage-integration-to-streamline-legal-workflows))

**Laura Wenzel, Global Marketing and Insights Director at iManage**: "That number is going to increase significantly. With the emergence of gen AI and the notion that it needs clean, curated, governed data to produce accurate, relevant results, this is only changing the mindset of many legal professionals and law firms, who historically may not have curated content." ([ABA Journal](https://www.abajournal.com/columns/article/midsize-law-firms-are-balancing-potential-and-pitfalls-in-charting-an-unpredictable-path-forward))

**James Temple, Chief Operating Officer at Seddons GSC**: "We selected iManage for its intuitive interface and ability to integrate effortlessly into the Microsoft ecosystem where our professionals already spend most of their time." ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/09/3163883/0/en/Seddons-GSC-Selects-iManage-to-Modernize-Document-and-Email-Management-with-Cloud-First-Approach.html))

## Strategic Implications

iManage's developments indicate a strategic pivot toward becoming the trusted foundational layer for AI-enabled legal workflows rather than competing directly with AI platforms. The company's "AI Confidence" positioning and open ecosystem approach allows it to maintain its core document management platform position while expanding capabilities through third-party integrations. This strategy addresses the market's dual need for AI innovation and security governance, potentially strengthening iManage's competitive moat as legal organizations require established, trusted platforms to support their AI initiatives. The emphasis on Microsoft ecosystem integration and cloud-first architecture positions the company well for hybrid work environments and enterprise adoption patterns.
