## Use Cases

### Healthcare Claims Processing

Health insurance companies automate claims processing by routing incoming forms and medical documents through NOVO CxP workflows. The platform classifies claim types, extracts patient information, treatment codes, and cost data from submitted documents including handwritten forms and scanned records. Integration with insurance management systems enables automatic claim validation against policy coverage, while flagged cases route to adjusters for manual review. The system handles multi-channel submissions from email, patient portals, and provider systems.

### Invoice Processing

Finance departments process incoming invoices by extracting vendor details, line items, tax amounts, and payment terms from PDF and email attachments. NOVO AI Studio handles XRechnung electronic invoice formats alongside traditional paper invoices, normalizing data for ERP system integration. The platform validates extracted data against purchase orders and contracts, routes invoices through approval workflows, and exports approved transactions to accounting systems.
