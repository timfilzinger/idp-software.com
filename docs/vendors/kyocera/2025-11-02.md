## News Review for kyocera

# Kyocera Corporation News Review

## Executive Summary

Kyocera faces a mixed period of market recognition and security challenges, with the company identified as a key player across multiple growing technology markets while simultaneously dealing with a critical cybersecurity incident. The corporation was recognized among key players in the MEMS packaging substrates market projected to reach $3.23 billion by 2030 ([PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/mems-packaging-substrates-market-worth-3-23-billion-by-2030---exclusive-report-by-marketsandmarkets-302600766.html)) and listed in research covering the piezoelectric materials market expected to grow to $2.456 billion by 2030 ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/17/3168694/28124/en/Piezoelectric-Materials-Market-Outlook-2025-2030-Consumer-Electronics-and-Renewable-Energy-Propel-Growth.html)). However, the company's reputation was impacted by a critical security vulnerability (CVE-2025-61932) in subsidiary Motex's Landscope Endpoint Manager, which achieved a 9.3/10 severity score and was actively exploited before patches became available ([TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/cisa-warns-motex-landscope-endpoint-manager-has-a-worrying-security-flaw-so-patch-now), [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-warns-of-lanscope-endpoint-manager-flaw-exploited-in-attacks/)). On the positive side, Kyocera Communication Systems opened a zero-emission data center in Ishikari, Japan, demonstrating commitment to sustainable infrastructure ([ArchDaily](https://www.archdaily.com/1035309/zero-emission-data-center-ishikari-zed-ishikari-taisei-design-planners-architects-and-engineers)), while the parent company advanced into sustainable battery technology by commercializing 24M's Lithium Forever recycling technology ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmorris/2025/10/11/extreme-h-electric-suv-racing-scientist-says-hydrogen-future-is-orange/)). The company also maintained its position as the 57th largest patent recipient in 2024 ([IP Watchdog](https://ipwatchdog.com/2025/10/24/other-barks-bites-epo-research-institution-patents-doubled/)) and was included among companies developing 6G communications technologies, indicating involvement in next-generation infrastructure development.

## Key Developments

**Security Incident**: Kyocera subsidiary Motex faced a critical security breach when CISA added vulnerability CVE-2025-61932 in their Landscope Endpoint Manager to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog. The 9.3/10 severity flaw enables remote code execution and was actively exploited as a zero-day, affecting versions 9.4.7.2 and earlier with federal agencies required to patch by November 12.

**Sustainable Infrastructure**: Kyocera Communication Systems launched a 5,354 square meter zero-emission data center in Ishikari, Japan, operating on 100% renewable energy and completed in 2024, positioning the company in Japan's sustainable data center market.

**Battery Technology Partnership**: Kyocera commercialized 24M's Lithium Forever technology to manufacture batteries with improved environmental recycling capabilities, addressing sustainability concerns in battery manufacturing and end-of-life processing.

**Market Recognition**: The company was identified as a key player in the MEMS packaging substrates market projected to grow from $2.40 billion in 2025 to $3.23 billion by 2030, and listed among companies in the piezoelectric materials market expected to reach $2.456 billion by 2030.

**6G Development**: Kyocera appeared in multiple research reports as one of the companies involved in 6G communications materials and hardware development for the 2026-2046 timeframe, suggesting participation in next-generation communications infrastructure.

## Market Context

Kyocera's market positioning reflects broader industry trends toward sustainable technology and advanced materials, with the company benefiting from its strategic location in Japan's technology ecosystem. The MEMS packaging substrates market growth is driven by IoT, 5G deployment, and medical device expansion, areas where Kyocera's ceramic expertise provides competitive advantages. The company's Asia Pacific location offers proximity to major OEMs including Samsung, Sony, Huawei, and Panasonic. However, the security incident at subsidiary Motex highlights the growing cybersecurity challenges facing technology companies, particularly those operating endpoint management solutions in increasingly targeted markets like Japan and Asia.

## Strategic Implications

The security vulnerability at Motex represents a reputational risk that could impact customer trust in Kyocera's technology solutions, particularly in cybersecurity-sensitive markets. However, the company's diversified technology portfolio provides resilience, with recognition across multiple growing markets including MEMS, piezoelectric materials, and 6G development indicating strong positioning for future growth. The zero-emission data center launch and battery recycling technology commercialization demonstrate Kyocera's strategic pivot toward sustainable technology solutions, potentially providing competitive advantages as environmental regulations tighten. The company's inclusion in 6G development research suggests long-term positioning in next-generation communications infrastructure, while its ranking as the 57th largest patent recipient indicates continued innovation investment across its technology portfolio.
