# LandingAI

LandingAI is a visual AI company founded by Andrew Ng that provides computer vision and document intelligence solutions through its LandingLens and Agentic Document Extraction platforms.

## Overview

LandingAI is headquartered in Mountain View, California and was founded by Andrew Ng, co-founder of Coursera, founding lead of Google Brain, and former chief scientist at Baidu. The company serves over 30,000 users across industries including automotive, life sciences, electronics, manufacturing, food and beverages, infrastructure, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals.

The company offers two primary platforms: LandingLens for building and deploying computer vision models, and Agentic Document Extraction for intelligent [document-understanding](../../capabilities/document-understanding/index.md). LandingAI's technology reduces time to deployment by approximately 80% through low-code interfaces and visual prompting capabilities.

The platform focuses on industries requiring high accuracy where workflows are primed for agentic efficiencies, including finance, healthcare, insurance, and compliance. Companies using LandingAI's document extraction reported up to a 90% reduction in time spent searching for information.

## Key Features

- **Agentic Document Extraction**: API-first platform converting multi-modal documents into structured, auditable intelligence
- **Document Pre-trained Transformer**: DPT-2 model for accurate extraction from complex document layouts
- **LandingLens Platform**: Low-code computer vision model building and deployment
- **VisionAgent**: Generative AI application builder for vision-enabled solutions
- **Visual Prompting**: Instantaneous model creation through visual conversations
- **Form Field Recognition**: Captures form fields, tables, and checkboxes with visual layout context
- **Element Description**: Provides accurate descriptions based on visual layout
- **Bounding Box Detection**: Identifies and locates document elements precisely
- **Multi-Modal Processing**: Handles text, images, and visual document elements
- **Deployment-Ready Code**: Generates code, tools, and models for production use

## Use Cases

### Financial Document Processing

Financial institutions process statements, contracts, and regulatory filings with LandingAI's Agentic Document Extraction. The platform extracts financial data from complex layouts including nested tables and multi-column formats. It maintains audit trails through element traceability and provides visual context for extracted information. The system handles compliance documentation where accuracy is mandatory.

### Healthcare Document Intelligence

Healthcare organizations digitize clinical forms, medical records, and research documentation using the document intelligence platform. The system recognizes form fields, checkboxes, and table structures in medical documents. It extracts patient information, treatment data, and clinical observations while maintaining context. The visual AI capabilities handle both standardized forms and variable-format medical documents.

### Manufacturing Visual Inspection

Manufacturing companies deploy computer vision models through LandingLens for quality control and defect detection. The visual prompting interface allows users to build inspection models without extensive coding. Teams train models with minimal data and deploy them across production lines. The platform supports automotive, electronics, and medical device manufacturing sectors with real-time visual inspection capabilities.
