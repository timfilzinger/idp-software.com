## News Review for mulesoft

# MuleSoft News Review

## Executive Summary

MuleSoft's role within Salesforce's ecosystem has evolved substantially as the company positions the integration platform as critical infrastructure for its "agentic enterprise" strategy, with new capabilities including Agent Script for deterministic AI agent outcomes and Agent Fabric for multi-vendor agent orchestration announced at Dreamforce ([Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/salesforce-dreams-of-the-agentic-enterprise/)). The integration platform has been incorporated into Salesforce's Data 360 unified data foundation alongside Data Cloud, Tableau, and the pending Informatica acquisition, serving as the "governed bridge" connecting AI agents to legacy systems of record ([SiliconAngle](https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/18/salesforces-next-era-agentic-enterprise/)). MuleSoft now functions within what Salesforce terms an "intelligent integration fabric" with enhanced security capabilities including mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) authentication for Salesforce integrations, while also supporting the beta launch of Hosted Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers that enable AI agents to access Salesforce data across enterprise departments without custom coding, with General Availability targeted for February 2026 ([Salesforce Developer](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2025/10/salesforce-hosted-mcp-servers-are-in-beta-today)). Market research firms have recognized MuleSoft as a key player in both the AI integration platforms market, projected to grow by $40.90 billion from 2024 to 2029 with a 32.6% CAGR, and the AI-enhanced RPA market expected to expand by $14.28 billion with a 33% CAGR ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/08/3163198/28124/en/AI-Integration-Platforms-Market-Growth-and-Competition-Analysis-2025-2029-Convergence-of-IPaaS-and-MLOps-Drive-Business-in-the-Industry.html)).

## Key Developments

**Product Launches and Enhancements:**
- Launch of Agent Script capability for bringing deterministic outcomes through rules for AI agents, though analysts noted limitations for complex tasks ([Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/salesforce-dreams-of-the-agentic-enterprise/))
- Introduction of Agent Fabric leveraging MuleSoft's API management capabilities to provide cataloging, governance, agent orchestration, and runtime visibility across all agents, working with both Salesforce and third-party platforms ([Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/salesforce-dreams-of-the-agentic-enterprise/))
- Beta release of Salesforce Hosted MCP Servers integrating with MuleSoft to enable AI agents to access Salesforce data across enterprise departments, with General Availability targeted for February 2026 ([Salesforce Developer](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2025/10/salesforce-hosted-mcp-servers-are-in-beta-today))
- Enhanced Salesforce Connector with mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) authentication capabilities to address security challenges in dynamic cloud environments ([Salesforce Developer](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2025/10/enhance-integration-security-with-mtls-for-salesforce-and-mulesoft))

**Strategic Integration:**
- Integration into Salesforce's Data 360 unified data foundation alongside Data Cloud, Tableau, and Informatica acquisition ([SiliconAngle](https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/16/salesforce-data-360-agentic-ai-dreamforce/))
- Evolution into what Salesforce calls an "intelligent integration fabric" with unified control plane through Anypoint Flexible Gateway ([SiliconAngle](https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/18/salesforces-next-era-agentic-enterprise/))

## Market Context

MuleSoft's developments occur within a broader enterprise transformation toward AI-driven automation and agentic workflows. The integration platform market is experiencing substantial growth, with AI integration platforms projected to expand by $40.90 billion from 2024 to 2029 at a 32.6% CAGR ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/08/3163198/28124/en/AI-Integration-Platforms-Market-Growth-and-Competition-Analysis-2025-2029-Convergence-of-IPaaS-and-MLOps-Drive-Business-in-the-Industry.html)). The shift from traditional task-based automation to orchestrated AI agent collaboration positions integration platforms like MuleSoft as foundational infrastructure rather than point solutions. Enterprise adoption of zero-trust security architecture and cloud-native authentication mechanisms drives demand for enhanced security features like mTLS authentication, particularly as organizations move to dynamic cloud environments where traditional IP allowlisting becomes operationally burdensome.

## Notable Quotes

**Rahul Auradkar, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Unified Data Services at Salesforce:** "We have built Data 360 from the ground up on standards … we are an open and extensible platform. That sort of an ecosystem vibrancy is needed for data fluidity that allows us to provide intelligent context in the moment." ([SiliconAngle](https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/16/salesforce-data-360-agentic-ai-dreamforce/))

We just did a session earlier today on Informatica and being able to get your data governance right, being able to get your data quality right, so that you can feed that into Salesforce and Agentforce. [Being] able to build those agents is going to be key." ([SiliconAngle](https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/21/ai-rewriting-rules-enterprise-operations-value-creation-dreamforce/))

## Strategic Implications

MuleSoft's strategic position has shifted from standalone integration platform to essential infrastructure within Salesforce's agentic enterprise architecture. The platform's evolution into an "intelligent integration fabric" positions it as the nervous system connecting AI agents to enterprise data and legacy systems, potentially expanding its total addressable market beyond traditional API management. However, analyst feedback indicates limitations in complex scenario handling, suggesting MuleSoft must enhance its capabilities to fully support Salesforce's agentic enterprise vision. The integration with emerging standards like Model Context Protocol and enhanced security features demonstrates adaptation to AI-driven workflows and zero-trust security requirements. Market recognition in both AI integration platforms and RPA sectors validates MuleSoft's relevance in the evolving automation landscape, though competition from cloud-native alternatives and hyperscaler platforms requires continued innovation to maintain differentiation.
