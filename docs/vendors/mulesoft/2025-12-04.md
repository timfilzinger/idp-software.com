## Notable Quotes

Adam Evans, executive vice president and general manager of Salesforce AI, emphasized the strategic importance of AI agent management: "As AI adoption accelerates, the biggest enterprise challenge will no longer be about building an organization's first agent; it will become how to best manage a fleet of agents that are making real-world business decisions" ([source](https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/20/salesforce-launches-deep-observability-tools-agentic-ai/)).
