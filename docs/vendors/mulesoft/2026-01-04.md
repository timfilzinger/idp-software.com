## News Review for mulesoft

# MuleSoft News Review

## Executive Summary

MuleSoft experienced several strategic developments during this period, most notably its inclusion in Salesforce's new Agentic Enterprise License Agreement (AELA) that shifts the integration platform from consumption-based to unlimited usage pricing for fixed fees over 2-3 year terms ([Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/ai-agents-become-economic-actors-salesforce-rewrites-the-rules-of-pricing/)). The company positioned its Agent Fabric as an orchestration layer for multi-vendor AI agents, competing against ServiceNow, AWS, and IBM in the emerging agentic AI market ([TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/news/366636690/Agentic-orchestration-the-next-AI-issue-for-CIOs-to-tackle)). MuleSoft's Healthcare Accelerator achieved notable results with 70% reduction in prior authorization processing times and 95% accuracy rates in pilot programs ([Digital Journal](https://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-science/ai-agent-pioneer-sparks-new-momentum-in-healthcare-transformation/article)). Following Salesforce's $8 billion Informatica acquisition, executives clarified MuleSoft's role as the real-time operational layer providing event-driven connections while Informatica handles enterprise-wide data context ([SiliconAngle](https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/09/salesforce-defines-informaticas-role-unified-data-strategy/)). The platform also gained federal government validation through deployment at the U.S. Transportation Department's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration for interstate data exchange ([NextGov](https://www.nextgov.com/modernization/2025/12/transportation-planning-expand-its-use-agentic-ai-capabilities/410082/)).

## Key Developments

**Pricing Model Transformation**: MuleSoft was included in Salesforce's new Agentic Enterprise License Agreement (AELA), moving from consumption-based to unlimited usage pricing for fixed fees over 2-3 year terms, bundled with Agentforce and Data 360/Data Cloud ([Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/ai-agents-become-economic-actors-salesforce-rewrites-the-rules-of-pricing/)).

**AI Agent Orchestration**: MuleSoft Agent Fabric was positioned among competing orchestration platforms for managing AI agents from multiple vendors, aiming to serve as a connecting layer for multi-vendor agent environments ([TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/news/366636690/Agentic-orchestration-the-next-AI-issue-for-CIOs-to-tackle)).

**Healthcare Market Success**: MuleSoft Healthcare Accelerator achieved 70% reduction in prior authorization timelines with 95% accuracy rates in pilot programs, deployed by partners including Deloitte, Accenture, and PWC ([Digital Journal](https://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-science/ai-agent-pioneer-sparks-new-momentum-in-healthcare-transformation/article)).

**Government Deployment**: The U.S. Transportation Department deployed MuleSoft for interstate data exchange at the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ([NextGov](https://www.nextgov.com/modernization/2025/12/transportation-planning-expand-its-use-agentic-ai-capabilities/410082/)).

**Third-Party Development**: Version 0.2.0 of an unofficial Python SDK for MuleSoft's Anypoint Platform was released, indicating developer interest in the platform ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/anypoint-sdk/0.2.0/)).

## Market Context

MuleSoft operates in an increasingly competitive integration and AI orchestration market where enterprises run an average of 897 applications with many incorporating agentic AI capabilities. The shift to unlimited usage pricing positions integration platforms as strategic capabilities rather than metered services, while the healthcare AI automation market is projected to exceed $12 billion by 2028 according to Forrester. The federal government's adoption validates MuleSoft's capabilities in regulated environments, strengthening its credibility for other government and regulated industry prospects.

## Notable Quotes

**Jennifer Cramer**, Senior Vice President of Forward Deployed Engineering and Customer Success for AI Products at Salesforce, stated: "We want to be the single agentic solution. But where they're having point agent solutions [from other companies], we want to be the layer that connects them all" ([TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/news/366636690/Agentic-orchestration-the-next-AI-issue-for-CIOs-to-tackle)).

**Miguel Milano**, Chief Revenue Officer at Salesforce, explained: "Salesforce is OK with losing money on some AI deals. If customers use agents so extensively that Salesforce loses money, those customers become the happiest — and Salesforce has decades to monetize the value created" ([Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/ai-agents-become-economic-actors-salesforce-rewrites-the-rules-of-pricing/)).

**Vara Imandi**, Salesforce Executive, commented: "The next wave of healthcare transformation will not be defined by moonshot cures, but by the systemic elimination of operational friction. This is being achieved by invisible, autonomous AI that automates administrative burdens to restore the industry's human-centric purpose" ([Digital Journal](https://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-science/ai-agent-pioneer-sparks-new-momentum-in-healthcare-transformation/article)).

**Rahul Auradkar**, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Unified Data Services for Data 360 and AI Foundations at Salesforce, clarified: "Informatica brings the industry-wide, industry-standard, highly regarded [master data management]. MuleSoft, by contrast, supplies the real-time operational signals such as inventory changes, shipment delays and order exceptions that enable AI to trigger appropriate actions" ([SiliconAngle](https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/09/salesforce-defines-informaticas-role-unified-data-strategy/)).

## Strategic Implications

MuleSoft's inclusion in Salesforce's unlimited usage pricing model represents a strategic repositioning from utility service to core enterprise capability, potentially accelerating adoption while forcing competitors to shift toward outcome-based pricing models. The company's focus on AI agent orchestration positions it to capture value in the emerging agentic AI market, though it faces competition from ServiceNow, AWS, and IBM. The clarification of MuleSoft's role following the Informatica acquisition as the real-time operational layer maintains its distinct value proposition while complementing Salesforce's broader data management strategy. Success in healthcare automation and federal government deployments demonstrates MuleSoft's ability to penetrate regulated industries, while the partner-centric approach through consulting firms enables scaling without direct market entry. The platform's evolution from standalone integration tool to integral component of Salesforce's unified Customer 360 strategy validates the approach of embedding integration capabilities within comprehensive business ecosystems.

## Summary

Salesforce's MuleSoft Agent Fabric is positioned among competing orchestration platforms as enterprises face the emerging challenge of managing multiple AI agents from different vendors. With enterprises running an average of 897 applications and many vendors adding agentic AI capabilities, MuleSoft aims to serve as the connecting layer for multi-vendor agent environments rather than seeking to be an exclusive solution, acknowledging customer preferences for controlling their own orchestration layers while competing against ServiceNow, AWS, IBM, and other vendors for this emerging market.
