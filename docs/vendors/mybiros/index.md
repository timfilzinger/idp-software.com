## Use Cases

### Insurance Claims Management

Insurance companies process claim submissions by automatically extracting policy numbers, claim amounts, incident details, and supporting documentation from photos, repair estimates, and medical reports. The platform identifies document types from mixed submissions, extracts line items from invoices and receipts, and validates consistency across related documents. Confidence scores on extracted fields enable automated processing of high-confidence claims while routing uncertain cases for human review. Integration with claims management systems populates case files and triggers approval workflows.

### Financial Services Onboarding

Banks and lenders streamline customer onboarding by processing identity documents, income verification, and financial statements. The platform extracts personal information from passports and ID cards with signature detection for authentication, pulls salary data and employment details from payslips, and identifies bank account information from statements. Multi-document validation checks consistency across submitted materials to detect potential fraud or errors. Extracted data flows directly into CRM systems and triggers credit assessment workflows.
