## Use Cases

### Accounts Payable Automation

Finance teams automate invoice processing from capture through payment by uploading invoices via email, scan, or electronic formats. Nanonets extracts header details, line items, payment terms, and tax amounts, then validates data through three-way matching against purchase orders and receiving documents. The system routes invoices through approval workflows based on amount thresholds and cost centers, integrating with ERP systems for payment processing.

### Healthcare Document Processing

Healthcare providers process patient intake forms, insurance cards, medical records, and test results through automated [data extraction](../../capabilities/extraction/index.md). The platform captures patient demographics, insurance details, medical history, and clinical data, populating EHR systems directly while maintaining HIPAA compliance through encrypted data handling and access controls.

### Expense Management

Organizations automate expense reimbursement by capturing receipts through mobile photos or email attachments. The system extracts merchant details, purchase dates, itemized expenses, and payment information, then categorizes receipts by expense type and flags policy violations. Integration with expense management platforms accelerates reimbursement processing and provides spending analytics.
