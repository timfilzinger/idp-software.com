## News Review for onbase

# OnBase News Review

## Executive Summary

Hyland, the parent company of OnBase, appointed former Informatica Chief Product Officer Jitesh Ghai as president and CEO in mid-2024 following the retirement of longtime CEO Bill Priemer, with Ghai tasked to integrate OnBase alongside Alfresco and Nuxeo into a unified Content Innovation Cloud platform powered by agentic AI. The new leadership direction positions OnBase within a hybrid, multi-cloud architecture strategy that enables AI capabilities across existing customer deployments without requiring data migration, leveraging Hyland's custodianship of hundreds of petabytes of data for 14,000 customers primarily in regulated industries. This transformation places OnBase at the center of Hyland's competitive response to data lakehouse vendors attempting to extract unstructured data from enterprise content management systems while competing against established players like OpenText in the AI-enabled ECM space.

## Market Context

The developments reflect the broader enterprise content management industry's transition toward AI-first product models, with OnBase positioned within Hyland's response to competitive pressure from both traditional ECM vendors like OpenText and emerging data lakehouse vendors seeking to centralize unstructured data processing. Hyland's approach of AI-enabling OnBase within existing customer environments addresses the challenge of delivering modern AI capabilities while maintaining compliance requirements critical to regulated industries that form OnBase's core customer base.

## Notable Quotes

## Strategic Implications

The leadership change and platform integration strategy positions OnBase for transformation from a traditional enterprise content management system into an AI-enabled component of Hyland's broader content innovation platform. The hybrid cloud approach allows OnBase to maintain its strength in regulated industries while adding AI capabilities that compete with modern data platforms. This strategy leverages OnBase's existing customer base and compliance expertise as competitive advantages in the AI transformation, rather than requiring customers to migrate to entirely new platforms. The success of this approach will depend on Hyland's ability to deliver meaningful AI capabilities through OnBase while maintaining the security and compliance standards required by its regulated industry customer base.
