## Use Cases

### Healthcare Records Management

Healthcare organizations digitize medical records, patient forms, and administrative documents through OnBase capture solutions. The platform integrates with EMR systems to provide document access within clinical workflows, maintaining HIPAA compliance through encryption and audit trails. Automated retention policies manage record lifecycles according to regulatory requirements.

### Accounts Payable Automation

Finance departments automate invoice processing by capturing documents from email, scan, and electronic sources. OnBase extracts vendor details, amounts, and line items, then routes invoices through approval workflows based on amount thresholds and business rules. Three-way matching validates invoices against purchase orders and receipts before ERP integration for payment processing.

### Government Case Management

Government agencies manage citizen service cases by consolidating related documents, communications, and activities in unified case folders. Workflow automation routes cases through appropriate channels based on case type and complexity, while audit trails maintain complete activity histories for compliance and transparency requirements.
