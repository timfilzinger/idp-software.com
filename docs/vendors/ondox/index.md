## Use Cases

### Insurance Claims Processing

Insurance carriers automate claims intake by processing submissions from email, mobile apps, and customer portals. Ondox classifies incoming documents as policies, claims forms, photos, repair estimates, or medical records, then extracts relevant policy numbers, claim amounts, incident dates, and loss details. The platform routes complete submissions to adjusters while flagging incomplete cases for follow-up. Case workspaces aggregate all documents related to a claim number, enabling adjusters to review materials and share information with external repair shops or medical providers. Analytics dashboards track processing volumes and turnaround times across claim types.

### Digital Mailroom Automation

Organizations process physical mail and email by digitizing incoming correspondence and routing documents to appropriate departments. Ondox identifies document types from scanned mail batches, extracts sender information and reference numbers, and distributes items to case management workspaces or employee inboxes based on routing rules. The system handles invoices by extracting vendor details and amounts for accounts payable, routes customer inquiries to service teams with extracted contact information, and archives correspondence for compliance. External sharing enables collaboration with vendors and partners without granting system access.
