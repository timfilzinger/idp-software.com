# Parsewise

Parsewise is an AI-powered platform that automates data extraction, resolution, and validation from document packages for investment and underwriting teams.

## Overview

Parsewise was founded in 2024 by Max Hofer (CEO) and Greg Csegzi (CTO) as part of Y Combinator's Spring 2025 batch. The platform serves investment management, reinsurance, and life sciences sectors, helping risk and compliance teams, analytics professionals, and data engineers accelerate document-intensive workflows.

The platform applies AI to parse complex document packages through [extraction](../../capabilities/extraction/index.md) and [document-understanding](../../capabilities/document-understanding/index.md) while maintaining end-to-end traceability. Every extracted output is traced to its exact source and highlighted with bounding boxes. Business experts retain granular control over data extraction logic and consistency check strategies. Parsewise has helped companies reduce week-long document processing tasks to hours.

Max Hofer holds a PhD in Computer Science and Economics and previously worked at Bain, while Greg Csegzi comes from Palantir with experience in life sciences and insurance sectors.

## Key Features

- **Exhaustive Processing**: AI agents parse documents comprehensively and flag issues proactively
- **Multi-Format Support**: Processes PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX files
- **Automated Validation**: Cross-references and validates extracted data for consistency
- **Document Package Handling**: Processes collections of related documents together
- **GDPR Compliance**: Full compliance with data protection regulations
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypts data both in transit and at rest

## Use Cases

### Investment Due Diligence

Investment teams use Parsewise to analyze document packages during due diligence processes. The platform extracts financial metrics, operational data, and risk factors from pitch decks, financial statements, and legal documents. It cross-references information across multiple documents and flags inconsistencies, allowing analysts to focus on evaluation rather than manual data collection.

### Insurance Underwriting

Reinsurance companies automate underwriting workflows by processing policy documents, risk assessments, and claims histories. Parsewise extracts key underwriting parameters and validates data across document sets. The transparent traceability allows underwriters to verify extracted information and adjust extraction logic for specific policy types or risk categories.

### Life Sciences Regulatory Review

Life sciences organizations process clinical trial documentation, regulatory submissions, and research data. The platform extracts structured information from complex scientific documents while maintaining audit trails. Compliance teams verify extracted data by reviewing source highlights and adjust validation rules to meet regulatory requirements.
