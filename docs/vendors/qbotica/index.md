## Use Cases

### Invoice Processing Automation

Finance teams automate supplier invoice capture, validation, and processing across multiple formats and channels. Qbotica extracts header information, line items, tax details, and payment terms without requiring vendor-specific templates, then validates data against purchase orders and receiving documents. Clean invoices route through approval workflows while exceptions flag for review, with ERP integration enabling automated posting and payment initiation.

### Healthcare Claims Processing

Healthcare organizations automate medical claims extraction and validation from various form types. The platform captures patient demographics, diagnosis codes, procedure codes, and billing amounts, identifying coding errors and compliance issues before payer submission. Integration with EHR systems ensures clinical documentation consistency while analytics track claim volumes, rejection rates, and reimbursement patterns.

### Customer Onboarding

Financial institutions process new customer applications by automating extraction from forms, identity documents, and supporting documentation. Document intelligence verifies authenticity and consistency while automated workflows route applications through KYC, AML, and credit checks. Integration with core banking systems enables straight-through processing for standard applications with exception handling for complex cases.
