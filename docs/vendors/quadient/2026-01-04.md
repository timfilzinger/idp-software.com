# Quadient News Review

## Executive Summary

Quadient achieved a major regulatory milestone with its Serensia subsidiary receiving final accreditation from the French Tax Authority (DGFiP) as a registered e-invoicing platform, positioning the company among a select group of certified operators ahead of France's mandatory e-invoicing rollout on September 1, 2026 ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/11/3204153/0/en/E-Invoicing-the-Serensia-by-Quadient-platform-receives-final-accreditation-by-the-French-Tax-Authority.html)). The platform, acquired by Quadient in spring 2025, is set to process more than 250 million invoices under the reform and already serves major clients including TotalEnergies and BPCE. Additionally, Quadient released research data showing UK package theft reached £666.5 million annually with 4.83 million homes affected, representing a 31% increase from the previous year ([The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/life-style/parcel-theft-uk-consumer-rights-refund-replacement-stealing-b2875498.html)), demonstrating the company's research capabilities in logistics analytics. The company also continues to provide mail handling services for UK government agencies, processing correspondence for Planning Inspectorate applications through its Slough facility.

## Key Developments

**Regulatory Certification**: Quadient's Serensia platform received final French Tax Authority accreditation as a registered e-invoicing platform, confirming operational readiness for France's mandatory e-invoicing requirements beginning September 1, 2026. The platform operates on sovereign cloud infrastructure with white-label capabilities and is designed to handle high-volume processing for enterprises.

**Market Research Publication**: Quadient released comprehensive data on UK package theft, revealing £666.5 million in annual losses affecting 4.83 million homes, with December identified as peak theft month and average stolen parcel value of £138. The research was conducted using Freedom of Information requests.

**Government Services**: Quadient continues providing mail handling services for UK government agencies, specifically processing postal correspondence for Section 62A planning applications through the Planning Inspectorate at its Slough facility.

## Market Context

The French e-invoicing certification positions Quadient in a mandatory compliance market with guaranteed adoption, as businesses will be required to use certified platforms starting September 2026. This regulatory requirement creates a protected revenue stream in the growing European digital transformation market. Quadient's package theft research establishes the company as a thought leader in logistics analytics, complementing its document processing capabilities with broader supply chain intelligence services.

## Notable Quotes

Geoffrey Godet, CEO of Quadient, stated: "This certification represents a long-term commitment to accompanying businesses and software vendors through a structural shift in the way invoicing will operate in France. As e-invoicing becomes an essential part of everyday business, organizations will need partners capable of supporting them not only at launch, but throughout the evolution of the reform and the increased digitalization of financial processes."

## Strategic Implications

The French e-invoicing certification establishes Quadient in a mandatory compliance market with recurring revenue potential from processing over 250 million invoices annually. The Serensia acquisition and subsequent certification demonstrate Quadient's strategy to expand beyond traditional document processing into regulated financial technology markets. The company's research capabilities in logistics analytics suggest potential expansion into broader supply chain intelligence services, while its government mail handling contracts provide stable revenue streams and demonstrate operational reliability for large-scale document processing operations.
