## Overview

ReadSoft, founded in 1991 by two university students in Linköping, Sweden, developed automated document processing solutions for financial operations. Lexmark acquired ReadSoft in 2014, and in 2017, Thoma Bravo combined ReadSoft with Kofax into a single company. Kofax rebranded to Tungsten Automation in 2024, integrating ReadSoft's invoice automation technology into the broader intelligent automation platform.

The solutions combine [OCR](../../capabilities/ocr/index.md), machine learning, and workflow automation to process invoices, purchase orders, and financial forms. ReadSoft's technology served organizations across financial services, manufacturing, healthcare, and public sector, with particular strength in accounts payable automation and ERP integration for SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics, and other enterprise systems.

## Use Cases

### Accounts Payable Automation

Finance departments automate invoice processing by capturing documents from email, scan, EDI, and supplier portals. ReadSoft extracts vendor information, invoice numbers, line items, tax amounts, and payment terms without requiring templates for each vendor format. The system validates data against ERP master data and purchase orders, routing clean invoices through approval workflows while flagging discrepancies for review.

### Purchase Order Processing

Organizations automate customer order handling by capturing orders from multiple channels and extracting customer details, product codes, quantities, pricing, and delivery requirements. Validation against customer master data and product catalogs identifies issues like discontinued items or pricing discrepancies, with ERP integration enabling automatic order creation.
