# Rippling News Review

## Executive Summary

Rippling has engaged The Prompting Company, a four-month-old startup that recently raised $6.5 million in seed funding, to utilize generative engine optimization (GEO) services aimed at improving the company's visibility in AI-powered product recommendations across platforms like ChatGPT and other AI applications. This partnership positions Rippling among early adopters preparing for a fundamental shift in how customers discover business software, as retailers anticipate up to a 520% increase in AI-driven traffic by 2025, moving away from traditional search methods toward AI agent-mediated product discovery and potentially procurement workflows.

## Key Developments

**Market Positioning**: The partnership represents Rippling's proactive approach to adapting marketing strategies for an emerging landscape where AI tools increasingly mediate customer product discovery processes, particularly relevant for HR and payroll solution procurement ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/the-prompting-company-snags-6-5m-to-help-products-get-mentioned-in-chatgpt-and-other-ai-apps/)).

## Market Context

The partnership reflects broader industry preparation for a transition from traditional search-based product discovery to AI-mediated recommendations. With projections indicating a potential 520% increase in AI-driven traffic by 2025, companies in the HR technology and business software sectors face pressure to optimize for AI agent discovery mechanisms. This trend particularly impacts B2B software companies like Rippling, where procurement decisions may increasingly involve AI tools that require specific optimization strategies to ensure product visibility in recommendation algorithms.

## Strategic Implications

Rippling's engagement with The Prompting Company demonstrates forward-looking marketing strategy adaptation, positioning the company for a landscape where AI agents may handle significant portions of product discovery and potentially procurement processes. This early investment in generative engine optimization suggests Rippling recognizes the competitive risk of reduced visibility in AI-powered workflows and is taking preemptive measures to maintain market presence. The move indicates strategic awareness that traditional SEO and marketing approaches may prove insufficient as customers increasingly rely on AI tools for business software selection, particularly in the HR and payroll technology sectors where Rippling operates.
