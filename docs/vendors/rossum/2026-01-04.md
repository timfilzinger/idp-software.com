## News Review for rossum

# Rossum News Review

## Executive Summary

Rossum has emerged as a recognized player in Eastern Europe's AI landscape while positioning itself as a thought leader in document automation and AI regulation. The company was listed among leading AI companies in Eastern Europe according to The Business Research Company's 2025 AI marketing market report (https://lifestyle.articlerich.com/story/385149/artificial-intelligence-in-marketing-market-competition-analysis-2025-how-players-are-shaping-growth/), released its AI Document Automation Trends 2025 report revealing that 49% of finance departments still operate without automation (https://www.digitaljournal.com/business/finances-most-brutal-month-why-the-year-end-close-is-driving-burnout/article), and saw CTO Petr Baudis contribute to UK AI regulation discussions advocating for measured regulatory approaches (https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366636561/The-AI-regulation-gap-Is-the-UKs-pro-innovation-approach-enough). These developments collectively demonstrate Rossum's strategy to establish market authority through research publication while maintaining a pragmatic stance on AI governance that supports innovation within the intelligent document processing sector.

## Key Developments

**Market Research and Thought Leadership**: Rossum published its AI Document Automation Trends 2025 report, which found that 49% of finance departments continue to rely on manual data entry and Excel spreadsheets, with UK finance teams showing 66% Excel dependency and 35% of UK departments classified as automation "laggards" (https://www.digitaljournal.com/business/finances-most-brutal-month-why-the-year-end-close-is-driving-burnout/article).

**Industry Recognition**: The company was recognized as one of the leading artificial intelligence companies in Eastern Europe in The Business Research Company's Artificial Intelligence In Marketing Global Market Report 2025, positioning it alongside other regional technology leaders (https://lifestyle.articlerich.com/story/385149/artificial-intelligence-in-marketing-market-competition-analysis-2025-how-players-are-shaping-growth/).

**Regulatory Positioning**: CTO Petr Baudis actively participated in UK AI regulation discussions, advocating for targeted intervention approaches and supporting the UK's pro-innovation regulatory framework (https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366636561/The-AI-regulation-gap-Is-the-UKs-pro-innovation-approach-enough).

## Market Context

These developments occur within a fragmented AI market where the top 10 players control only 19% of total revenue, creating opportunities for specialized companies like Rossum to establish market presence. The company's research highlighting widespread manual processes in finance departments aligns with broader industry trends showing an AI deployment gap where 63% of organizations claim full AI deployment but only 21% see measurable value. This environment creates substantial market opportunity for intelligent document processing solutions, particularly as finance professionals experience burnout from manual year-end processes.

## Notable Quotes

**Petr Baudis, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer, Rossum** (https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366636561/The-AI-regulation-gap-Is-the-UKs-pro-innovation-approach-enough):

"Centralised intervention should be reserved for issues with 'society-wide risks'" - discussing the UK's regulatory approach to AI governance.

"Existing regulators could manage sector-specific concerns for now, but only if there is a clear distinction between ordinary risks and those that require central action" - warning about fragmented oversight becoming an obstacle without clear risk categorization.

"Moving too quickly on sweeping legislation without consensus could be counterproductive to innovation and the UK's competitiveness" - emphasizing the balance between AI safety and maintaining competitive advantage.

## Strategic Implications

Rossum's multi-faceted approach demonstrates a strategy to build market authority beyond pure product development. By publishing industry research, the company establishes itself as a thought leader while simultaneously highlighting the substantial addressable market for its document automation solutions. The regulatory positioning through executive commentary shows Rossum's intent to influence policy discussions that could impact AI adoption rates. The recognition in Eastern European AI markets suggests potential expansion opportunities beyond core IDP applications, while the research findings validate the continued need for automation solutions in finance departments struggling with manual processes.
