## Use Cases

### Accounts Payable Automation

Organizations automate invoice processing by capturing documents from email, scan, and EDI channels. SoftCo extracts header and line-item data, validates information against purchase orders and receiving documents, then routes invoices through approval workflows based on amount thresholds and cost centers. ERP integration enables straight-through processing for matched invoices with complete audit trails for compliance.

### Procure-to-Pay Transformation

Financial departments streamline requisition creation, purchase order generation, supplier invoice processing, and payment execution through unified workflows. Three-way matching reconciles invoices with purchase orders and receipts automatically, while the supplier portal enables electronic invoice submission and status tracking. Analytics provide insights into spending patterns, supplier performance, and early payment discount opportunities.
