# Xerox Corporation News Review

## Executive Summary

Xerox Holdings Corporation completed a leadership transition with Chuck Butler's appointment as CFO effective December 3, replacing departing CFO Mirlanda Gecaj, bringing relevant integration experience from his previous role as SVP and CFO at Lexmark during its July 2025 acquisition by Xerox ([Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/11/26/future-treasury-2026-tech-mandate-finance-leaders/)). The company expanded into the augmented reality packaging market through its CareAR visual support platform, which enables AR-enabled label printing for on-demand product information and remote guidance, positioning Xerox in a market projected to grow from USD 383.34 billion in 2025 to USD 709.50 billion by 2034 ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/01/3197243/0/en/Augmented-Reality-in-Packaging-Market-Size-Trends-Segments-Companies-Competitive-Analysis-Value-Chain-Trade-Analysis-2025-2035.html)). However, the company faced cybersecurity challenges as its Business Solutions US division was targeted by the INC Ransom ransomware gang, and the Xerox brand was impersonated by Iran-aligned cyberespionage group MuddyWater in attacks targeting critical infrastructure in Israel and Egypt ([BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/onsolve-codered-cyberattack-disrupts-emergency-alert-systems-nationwide/), [Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/02/3198412/0/en/Iran-s-MuddyWater-targets-critical-infrastructure-in-Israel-and-Egypt-masquerades-as-Snake-game-ESET-Research-discovers.html)).

## Key Developments

**Leadership Changes**: Chuck Butler was promoted to CFO of Xerox Holdings Corporation effective December 3, succeeding Mirlanda Gecaj who departed December 2. Butler retains leadership of the Global Business Services organization and previously guided Lexmark through its acquisition by Xerox in July 2025.

**Product Enhancements**: Xerox entered the augmented reality packaging market through its CareAR visual support platform, offering AR-enabled label printing that embeds AR capabilities into labels for product information and remote guidance applications.

**Cybersecurity Incidents**: Xerox Business Solutions US division was listed among victims of the INC Ransom ransomware gang, while the Xerox brand was impersonated by Iran-aligned cyberespionage group MuddyWater in attacks using the VAX One backdoor targeting technology, engineering, manufacturing, government, and educational sectors.

## Market Context

Xerox's entry into the AR packaging market represents an extension of its traditional printing capabilities into digital experiences within a rapidly expanding sector. The company competes alongside specialized AR startups and major technology providers in a market experiencing substantial growth. The cybersecurity incidents reflect broader industry challenges, as ransomware-as-a-service operations increasingly target business services companies, while state-sponsored groups use brand impersonation tactics to evade detection in critical infrastructure attacks.

## Strategic Implications

The CFO appointment demonstrates continuity in leadership following the Lexmark acquisition, with Butler's integration experience supporting ongoing merger operations. The CareAR platform expansion into AR packaging leverages existing printing infrastructure while targeting new revenue streams in interactive packaging solutions. The cybersecurity incidents present reputational risks that could affect customer trust, particularly in security-sensitive markets, highlighting the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures as the company integrates acquired operations and expands its digital service offerings.

## Summary

Xerox was among several technology brands impersonated by Iran-aligned cyberespionage group MuddyWater in attacks targeting critical infrastructure organizations in Israel and Egypt. The group's VAX One backdoor masqueraded as legitimate software from Xerox and other vendors to evade detection while targeting technology, engineering, manufacturing, government, and educational sectors. This brand impersonation represents a reputational risk for Xerox in security-sensitive markets where customer trust is essential.
