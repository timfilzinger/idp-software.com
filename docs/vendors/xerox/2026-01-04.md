## News Review for xerox

# Xerox Corporation News Review

## Executive Summary

Xerox Corporation demonstrated operational focus on internal efficiency improvements and maintained presence in growing market segments during this review period. The company partnered with Stack Overflow to implement Stack Internal, a knowledge management platform addressing collaboration challenges across 400+ engineers and 280 contractors in its Workplace Solutions division, achieving 1,200+ questions with a 97% answer rate and onboarding 600 users within months ([Stack Overflow blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/12/23/how-xerox-and-stack-overflow-partnered-to-preserve-knowledge-and-power-innovation/)). Xerox was identified as a participant in the roll-to-roll printing market, projected to grow from $15.41 billion in 2025 to $23.09 billion by 2030 at 8.35% CAGR, competing alongside HP, Canon, and Konica Minolta ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/23/3209758/28124/en/23-Billion-Roll-to-Roll-Printing-Market-Outlook-2030-Analysis-of-New-Technologies-Key-Partnerships-and-Evolving-Business-Models.html)). The company's reduced physical footprint was evidenced by the redevelopment of former Fuji Xerox Towers in Singapore into Newport Residences, scheduled to launch in January 2026 ([Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/marina-bay-transformed-a-new-chapter-in-singapores-urban-planning-story)). Additionally, Xerox's business model principles continue to influence executives across industries, with Turners Automotive chairman Grant Baker crediting his Xerox experience for shaping the finance and service-centered approach that contributed to Turners' record $21.9 million first-half profit ([NZ Herald](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/companies/banking-finance/turners-boss-grant-baker-on-buying-dorchester-42-below-deal-and-his-love-of-ferraris/premium/7XRLWJTSNZHWTCAOZ47REJBHW4/)).

## Key Developments

**Strategic Partnerships**: Xerox implemented Stack Internal through a partnership with Stack Overflow to centralize knowledge management across its engineering teams. The platform addressed knowledge silos affecting 400 in-house engineers and 280 contractors, achieving 800+ authored articles, 65% quarterly active user engagement, and a median response time of two hours ([Stack Overflow blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/12/23/how-xerox-and-stack-overflow-partnered-to-preserve-knowledge-and-power-innovation/)).

**Market Positioning**: The company maintains participation in the roll-to-roll printing market, which serves applications in flexible electronics, smart packaging, and energy sectors. Market research positioned Xerox among key players in this segment expected to reach $23.09 billion by 2030 ([Globe Newswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/23/3209758/28124/en/23-Billion-Roll-to-Roll-Printing-Market-Outlook-2030-Analysis-of-New-Technologies-Key-Partnerships-and-Evolving-Business-Models.html)).

**Organizational Updates**: Xerox's physical presence in Singapore's central business district was reduced as former Fuji Xerox Towers are being converted to residential use under the city's urban renewal initiative ([Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/marina-bay-transformed-a-new-chapter-in-singapores-urban-planning-story)).

## Market Context

The developments reflect Xerox's focus on operational efficiency and participation in expanding market segments. The Stack Internal implementation addresses hybrid workplace challenges that affect many technology companies managing distributed engineering teams. The roll-to-roll printing market participation positions Xerox in applications beyond traditional document processing, including flexible electronics and smart packaging. The Singapore office conversion indicates potential real estate optimization as companies adapt post-pandemic workspace strategies.

## Notable Quotes

Grant Baker, Chairman of Turners Automotive, stated: "That model is very centred around finance and service. We've applied those lessons to the car business, and to the best of my knowledge there's no one else doing that," when discussing how his experience at Xerox influenced Turners Automotive's business model that contributed to record profits ([NZ Herald](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/companies/banking-finance/turners-boss-grant-baker-on-buying-dorchester-42-below-deal-and-his-love-of-ferraris/premium/7XRLWJTSNZHWTCAOZ47REJBHW4/)).

## Strategic Implications

Xerox's investment in internal knowledge management infrastructure through the Stack Overflow partnership demonstrates commitment to maintaining engineering excellence while scaling global operations. This operational focus on efficiency and knowledge retention should support long-term scalability goals. The company's participation in the growing roll-to-roll printing market provides access to emerging applications beyond traditional document processing, potentially diversifying revenue streams. The real estate optimization in Singapore may indicate broader workspace strategy adjustments. The continued influence of Xerox's business model principles across industries suggests the company's integrated service approach remains relevant and applicable, though this influence appears more historical than current strategic positioning.
